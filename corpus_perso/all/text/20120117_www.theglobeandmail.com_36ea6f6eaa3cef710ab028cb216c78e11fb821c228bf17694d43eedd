Since taking office in 2006, the federal bureaucracy had grown by some 33,000 jobs and federal spending has increased by $75-billion or 43 per cent. Now the government has determined it is time to cut back.Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, who is responsible for the CFIA, said in an e-mail on Monday that “Canadian families can be assured that the safety of our food supply will not be affected as federal departments and agencies look for ways to be more efficient and more financially prudent with taxpayer’s dollars.”But neither Mr. Ritz nor his department could explain how food safety would remain unscathed by the loss of inspectors in meat processing plants.Malcolm Allen, the agriculture critic for the opposition New Democrats, said food safety should be spared when the government makes its cuts. “This is really irresponsible on the government’s part to really take a machete when they need to take a scalpel,” he said. “This is one group that in my view should have been left alone.”Follow Gloria Galloway on Twitter: @glorgalTopics:Tony ClementMaple LeafCommentsPrint /LicenseAANext StoryIn the knowglobal wealthHow the world’s 62 richest people own more than half the planet doesLifeHotel Jackson offers Western chic amidst Wyoming cowboy cultureReport on BusinessSmall increases to your savings can make a big difference to your nest eggLifeCalifornia offers plenty of alternative wineries outside Napa ValleyMost popular videos »Globe DriveThe three coolest new cars revealed at the Detroit auto showArtsAnatomy of a scene: Is this the performance that wins Leo an Oscar?Report on BusinessHow do I know if I should avoid RRSPs like the plague?LifeThis exercise is called Take No Prisoners for a reasonLifeThree ways to cover stubborn grey roots (and save some cash)NewsSecurity footage shows massive cougar in North Vancouver backyardReport on BusinessBelgian drone mixes plane and quadcopter technologyReport on BusinessThis week in business: Bank of Canada's interest rate decisionArtsThis is what a 500-person choir singing Bowie's 'Space Oddity' sounds likeLifeThe ice cold call of winter surfing in Ontario (and why anyone would listen to it)Report on BusinessOn Blue Monday, don't let debt get you downNewsClinton, Sanders spar in last debate before Iowa◀●●●▶HighlightsGlobe InvestorBeing executor of a will likely ‘most stressful experience you’ll ever have’Globe InvestorFive U.S. sectors expected to outperform in 2016More from The Globe and MailReport on BusinessHow much did COS really win in Suncor battle?LifeNathalie Atkinson: Watching women walk, from a 1922 film gala to the 2016 OscarsMost popularLearn English or else: U.K. sends message to Muslim womenHow the world’s 62 richest people own more than half the planet doesRivals drop the rancour as Suncor, COS get $4.2-billion dealMorning Briefing: Analysts warn of further decay as loonie nears 68¢ before firmingRob Carrick: Eight reasons why a Bank of Canada rate cut is a bad ideaconnect with usProductsThe Globe and Mail NewspaperNewspaper delivered to your doorstep.
