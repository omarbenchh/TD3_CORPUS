In reality this means she is a breast care specialist who will be able to develop the island’s breast care service while providing vital general surgery on-call cover.Her appointment, plus plans to develop the service, means many women who would have had to travel off-island for treatment will no longer have to do so. She and her team at Noble’s Hospital will be charged with offering a wider range of enchanced services on-island, including oncoplastic breast surgery, sentinel node biopsy, immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, symmetrisation surgery and aesthetic breast reconstruction.Ms Bello, who has been a consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery for 10 years in the UK, has spent the last six-and-a-half years working at Nottingham University Hospital’s Breast Institute, a centre of excellence in the provision of breast care services.‘I am very excited about coming to the Isle of Man,’ she said. ‘I’ve already made a number of visits and the island offers an excellent quality of life. The community seems very friendly and I’ve already been made to feel welcome. I’m very much looking forward to working with colleagues to develop the island’s breast care service, ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care possible.’TrendingTake a look at Laxey bridge design options‘Please keep looking for Josh’Decided: The new bridge for old LaxeyCouncillor forced out of seat for not turning up to meetingsNunnery set to become University CollegeVideoStorm Frank1:27Bus recovery3:13Laxey Bus crash2:51More from NewsRoad blocked after accidentIsle of Man NewsMasked knifeman robs shopIsle of Man NewsRegister for TT HomestayIsle of Man NewsYou’ll be able to complete interim census onlineIsle of Man NewsPupils to find out more about CambodiaIsle of Man NewsFirefighters called to 2 kitchen incidentsIsle of Man NewsVideoStorm Frank1:27Bus recovery3:13Laxey Bus crash2:51Back to the top of the pageNewsSportWhat's OnWeatherPlace your AdSubscribeSpecial FeaturesDealsShopHolidaysDatingBingoBuy A PhotoLocal news on the moveKeep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.Visit this website on your mobile to start enjoying it on the move.Subscribe to the Isle Of Man ExaminerGet your favourite newspaper at a great low price.Call us on 0844 991 6464 or click here to start your subscription today!Newsletter sign upSign upNewsletter sign upSign upContact usIf you wish, you can contact us using any of the methods below.Publishing HousePeel RoadDouglasIsle of ManIM1 5EDEmail: newsdesk@newsiom.co.imTelephone: 01624 695695FAQsTerms and ConditionsDisclaimerCookies PolicySwitch to Mobile SiteAll rights reserved © 2016 Johnston Publishing Ltd.This website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.
