"We just never had it for this extended period of time before."Molnar said no single illness accounts for the high volume.Officials in Saskatoon say their hospitals, including St. Paul's, are filled. (CBC)Officials said they are finding space wherever they can, with some day surgery and recovery room beds being used for the overflow.They say that while Saskatoon is a growing city, they are not sure if they need to add more patient beds.The health region hopes the extra demand subsides.Report TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterLatest Saskatchewan News HeadlinesGas price drops to swinging 60s at some Regina pumpsJury selected at trial of Regina couple charged with killing 4-year-old girlNewLeaf discount airline postpones service, will refund ticketsUniversity of Regina Rams head coach resigns readcommentsSaskatoon author Jefferson Smith tests books on a treadmillreadcommentsLatest Audio and VideoAudioRegina Transition House marks 40th anniversary12:16VideoCross country ski trails in Regina1:18VideoOutdoors fun still do-able in the cold1:04VideoCBC News: Sask.
