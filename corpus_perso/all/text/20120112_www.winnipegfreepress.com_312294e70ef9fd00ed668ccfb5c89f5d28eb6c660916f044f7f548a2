But most of all, they were profoundly, hilariously ignorant about what goes into building a road.","last_updated":"2015-10-10T13:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*666/140807_ROAD_PROJECT008.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":336427231,"author":"Mia Rabson","title":"Hitting the ground running","last_modified":"2015-11-02T05:42:27.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":573,"path":"/canada","dimensions":"573x432","full_image_height":754,"content_type":"FP Long Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"CANADA-ELECTION/","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/573*432/_20145999.jpg","image_caption":"Liberal leader Justin Trudeau is embraced by his mother Margaret Trudeau (right) as he arrives to give his victory speech after Canada's federal election in Montreal.","image_credit":"Jim Young / REUTERS","cost":27,"image_dimensions":"573x432","section":"Canada","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/Hitting-the-ground-running-336427231.html","short_title":"Energy, engagement likely key to Trudeau\u2019s governing style","full_image_dimensions":"1000x754","publish_time":"2015-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":" OTTAWA &mdash; On the day after the election, the feeling of change was everywhere &mdash; in elevators, in coffee shops, at downtown bus stops.  | And people were repeatedly saying they expect big things of prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau.

The slanted headlamps and sharp crease on the hood give it an almost sinister look, a far cry from the happy smiling (and some would say goofy) small Mazdas of just a few years ago. Even the wide wheel arches and large fender flares look right, and the mirrors are mounted on the door instead of in the corner of the side window -- a clean design cue that also increases driver visibility.

Sharing the same basic uni-body chassis, the Cougar featured a three-inch longer wheelbase, different spring rates for a smoother ride and increased leg and trunk room over the Mustang. With an overall length of 190-inches it was more than six inches longer than the Mustang. Unless the two were side-by-side it was hard to tell the Cougar was a larger car. It was the Cougar's styling, however, that really brought the package together. The Cougar certainly didn't go unnoticed -- it received Motor Trend magazine's car of the year award for 1967 and accounted for almost half of Mercury sales for 1967. | With the 1967 model making such a great entry, Mercury didn't mess with success and only offered mild styling changes for 1968 with the inclusion of side marker lamps, dual hydraulic braking system with warning light, four-way emergency flashers, padded dash and sun visors, along with two-speed windshield wipers and washers as standard equipment. | In 1969, the second-generation Cougar emerged.

An excellent example of an imaginative design is the Kensington Homes show home at 148 Cherrywood Rd. in Bridgwater Trails.

We have removed our carpeting from our basement and now are considering what we should put in place of the carpet. We would like to put in laminate flooring, but people have told us this is not a good idea depending on moisture and that carpet tiles would be better. I'm confused. Is it OK to install laminate flooring? | Thank you, Shirley Trafton | Answer: Installing flooring on a concrete basement floor is often problematic, even in a dry basement. Condensation is always a consideration because the floor may be considerably cooler than the other basement surfaces, and special measures may have to be taken to prevent this from occurring. Laminate flooring may be a good choice, but should have subfloor protection to prevent damage from moisture. | Because the concrete slab in a basement floor is in contact with the soil beneath and touching the foundation walls at the perimeter, it may be considerably cooler than the air and surrounding surfaces in the same area. If the relative humidity (RH) is too high in the basement and air movement is stagnant, there is a high probability of condensation on the cool basement slab. If there is no floor covering on this slab, a small amount of condensation should eventually dry without any serious consequences.","last_updated":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","full_image":""},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","id":364729351,"author":"Reena Nerbas","title":"Wash vintage plastic penguin with dish soap and water","last_modified":"2016-01-09T08:05:51.000Z","image_type":"noimage","path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"","content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"","our_rating":"","image":"","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","image_dimensions":"","cost":27,"section":"Homes","url":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/content_id-364729351/","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"","publish_time":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"Question: I have an original Fisher-Price penguin pull toy from the early '70s.

According to the Fisher Price website; &quot;Regularly clean toys with dish soap and water (avoid anti-bacterial soaps). After cleaning, sanitize toys: dilute one tablespoon of bleach in one gallon (four litres) water.&quot; Wash and dry toys. Use a non-scratching, abrasive pad to erase marks. | Question: I am an amazing cook and all around fantastic housekeeper. My family and friends are always begging me to open my own restaurant. I love to cook and am an expert in international cuisine. I just have one question: I made cookie-cutter pancakes for my family on New Year's Day and I could not release the batter from the cookie cutter. Do you know any solutions for this? Roseanne, Emerson | Answer: Cooking is an art and it sounds like your family reaps the benefits of your gifts. Here are a few ideas for well-shaped individual pancakes: spray the cookie cutter with cooking spray before use. Make sure your frying pan is flat and the batter is thin enough to pour. Fill a squeeze bottle with the batter and squeeze the batter inside the cookie cutter to reach every corner. Alternatively, pour the batter inside the pan a little larger than the cutter. After the pancake is cooked, cut shapes using the cookie cutter. Or forget the cookie cutter and use the squeeze bottle to write names or draw pictures in the frying pan. When the batter bubbles, flip the pancake.","last_updated":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","full_image":""},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":480,"id":364729331,"author":"Todd Lewys","title":"New name, same great show","last_modified":"2016-01-09T08:05:45.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":320,"path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"320x480","full_image_height":1499,"content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"7534049","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/320*480/7534049.jpg","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","cost":27,"image_dimensions":"320x480","section":"Homes","url":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/content_id-364729331/","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"1000x1499","publish_time":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"Newsflash: the Kitchen, Bath & Reno Show has a new name.

A city report said the U of M is not a non-profit organization that offers sport or recreation activities or contributes to the health and well-being of the community. | It will cost $110,000 to relocate Eli Bornstein's Structurist Relief in Fifteen Parts to the Max Bell Centre at the U of M's campus. | St. Norbert Coun. Justin Swandel said the art is not his favourite piece, but there is an opportunity to keep part of the old airport's history alive. Transcona Coun. Russ Wyatt agreed, and said there is little difference between using the community grants to organizations to create murals, and helping relocate public art in the Max Bell Centre, a public facility.","last_updated":"2012-01-11T16:12:00.000Z","full_image":""},"pluckSection":"News","x_token_id":"8734F27899344FE3A2392EB64E913472","is_article_page":true};

																																									<p>Council's executive policy committee has voted in favour of giving the University of Manitoba a $10,000 grant to help relocate art from Winnipeg's old airport terminal.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>Winnipeg city administration initially recommended the grant not be approved since the U of M does not meet the regular criteria for a community incentive grant. A city report said the U of M is not a non-profit organization that offers sport or recreation activities or contributes to the health and well-being of the community.</p>

										<p>It will cost $110,000 to relocate Eli Bornstein's Structurist Relief in Fifteen Parts to the Max Bell Centre at the U of M's campus.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>St. Norbert Coun. Justin Swandel said the art is not his favourite piece, but there is an opportunity to keep part of the old airport's history alive. Transcona Coun. Russ Wyatt agreed, and said there is little difference between using the community grants to organizations to create murals, and helping relocate public art in the Max Bell Centre, a public facility.</p>														
										
										
																																									<p>Executive policy committee recommended that the grant be approved, though Mayor Sam Katz and Couns. Paula Havixbeck (Charleswood-Tuxedo) and Scott Fielding (St. James) voted against the proposal.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>Havixbeck said $10,000 is a significant amount of money and she can't support it given that it will be a difficult budget year and there are talks of a potential tax increase.</p>														
										
										
																																									<p>EPC also approved a plan to review the criteria for community incentive grants.</p>
