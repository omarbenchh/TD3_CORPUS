Now is not the time to run away from radical reform by diluting the Dilnot recommendations.”The Care and Support Alliance of charities including Age UK, Alzheimer’s Society, and Carers UK – yesterday urged politicians to strike a deal, saying: “The unavoidable challenge the country faces is how to support the increasing number who need care.“Social care has been put into the ‘too difficult’ tray by successive governments. These cross-party talks mean we are closer than ever to reaching a consensus on the future of the care and support system.”Dr Ros Altmann, director general of over-50s organisation Saga, said: “The lives of millions of older people and the future of the NHS is at stake.“Politicians in all parties have a historic opportunity to change the way care is funded in future, to help people stay in their own homes if they can, which is what they overwhelmingly want, and to save money for the NHS by caring for them outside the most expensive hospital settings.”Elderly people in England currently receive free care if they have savings of less than £13,000. Above that, they have to contribute to the cost of help with washing, dressing or eating. Anyone with savings of £23,250 must pay the full cost and many have had to sell their homes.Scotland provides free personal care for over-65s but it does not cover housework or shopping.DailyMirror>Recently PublishedGPs set to go on strike for first time in 40 yearsDoctors could strike for the first time in 40 years after rejecting the Government’s planned pension cuts, experts warned yesterdayImpact of Tories' botched health reforms revealed as bosses warn staff will be cutAndrew Lansley pays recruitment agencies £1m a month to replace sacked staffPrevious Articles800,000 hard-up pensioners left without basic careDAVID Cameron has come under fire over the appalling neglect facing elderly people in their retirement because they cannot afford basic care.Tories send NHS chiefs letters asking for their resignationRelated TagsOrganisationsAge UKNational Insurance Company Ltd.The TreasuryDepartment of HealthNHSPeopleAndrew LansleyAndy BurnhamGeorge OsborneAndrew DilnotSee AlsoSave moneyMental healthAlzheimer's diseaseHospitalsRecommended in UK NewsSainsbury'sSainsbury's recall BREAD amid fears it has been contaminated with METALZoosWatch two huge gorillas trade blows in furious zoo enclosure punch-upPoliticsYou don't know your wife's bra size?
