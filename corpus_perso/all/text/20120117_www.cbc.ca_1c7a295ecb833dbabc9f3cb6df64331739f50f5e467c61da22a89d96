Though by no means widespread, the practice is carried out by some immigrants to Canada, Kale says.His editorial cites a small U.S. study of about 65 immigrant Indian women that found 40 per cent had terminated earlier pregnancies, and 89 per cent pursued abortions in their most recent pregnancies after learning they were having girls. Previous Canadian research has suggested that sex selection is occurring in Canada in certain groups when families have had girls and are seeking a son.The practice has created a gender imbalance in these communities.A CMAJ editorial calls for gender disclosure policies at 30 weeks to be adopted by the provincial colleges that govern doctors."A pregnant woman being told the sex of the fetus at ultrasonography at a time when an unquestioned abortion is possible is the starting point of female feticide from a health-care perspective," writes Kale.A study done in Canada found a distorted ratio of male to female births in the Indo-Canadian community, particularly among couples that already have two daughters."So clearly female feticide is happening, especially at the time of the third child," Kale said.In the editorial, Kale proposes postponing the disclosure of the gender, which he called "medically irrelevant information" in most cases, until after about 30 weeks of pregnancy.Obstetricians group disagreesKale wants to see gender disclosure policies at 30 weeks adopted by the provincial colleges that govern doctors. "Such clear direction from regulatory bodies would be the most important step toward curbing female feticide in Canada."People may try to get around the regulation but that's no reason not to try, says Dr. Rajendra Kale. (CBC)The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada said Kale' s proposal is inconsistent with their policy, which states that "a patient's request for disclosure should be respected, either directly or in a report to the referring health professional."In an email to CBC News, the obstetricians group said it believes it is the right of the patient to be informed of the gender of the fetus.The editorial also did not consider tests on the market that give expectant parents a fetal sex determination of high accuracy as early as eight weeks into a pregnancy, the group notes.People will always try to get around regulations but that's no reason not to have them, Kale counters.The obstetricians group says it doesn't condone abortions based on non-medical reasons such as the gender of the fetus."The SOGC feels strongly that it is the cultural values and norms in specific segments of the Canadian population that must change to ensure that females are not confronted with procedures and intolerant environments before or after they are born," the association said.Education callDr. Pargat Singh Bhurji, a pediatrician in Surrey, B.C., calls the practice of female feticide barbaric."People [do]not want to come forward to talk about this," Bhurji said. "But what I'm saying is this is definitely happening."Couples can go to clinics in the U.S. that advertise early sex determination in Indian newspapers, Bhurji notes. Cultural factors such as dowry and the belief a boy is needed to carry the family name drive some, he adds.The long-term goal has to be education, Bhurji says.Dr. Samuel Soliman of the New Life Fertility Centre in Mississauga said some patients have told him they've had abortions after having a girl or two."I think it is part of the whole spectrum of violence against women, which starts from inside the uterus to the outside and the value of women," says Soliman.While the rule against disclosing gender might work in Canada, Soliman said, it would not apply in the U.S., Soliman notes.With files from CBC's Kelly Crowe and Pauline DakinReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterTop News HeadlinesRona Ambrose to address 'rapidly deteriorating' Canadian economyvideoHow new discount airlines could save you money, even if you don't fly them readcommentsEarth's oceans absorbed colossal amount of heat in past 18 yearsreadcommentsKevin O'Leary and Peter MacKay top Tory leadership pollreadcommentsTom Mulcair holds news conference ahead of 2-day NDP caucus gatheringMust WatchLatest Health News Headlines5 patients improve in fatal drug trial in France readcommentsThe downside of high rise livingreadcommentsPregnant women should consult doctors on travel: Brazil's health ministryreadcommentsMP Seamus O'Regan 40 days sober, 'reporting back for duty'readcommentsBlue Monday is (still) just a PR gimmick, actual science showsreadcommentsFeaturesMarketplaceToxic jewelry: Cadmium found in Ardene, Aldo productsJewelry bought from popular fashion chains contains toxic cadmiumMost ViewedFatal drug trial in France sees 5 patients improve, 1 sent home from hospital1 dead after botched clinical drug trial in France, 5 still in hospitalPregnant women should consult doctors on travel: Brazil's health ministryToxic jewelry: Cadmium found in Ardene, Aldo productsUrgent care centres an overlooked option for patientsPregnant women in Canada, U.S., urged to postpone travel to Zika-hit countriesClinical drug trial in France sends 6 to hospital in 'serious accident'Zika virus: Hawaiian baby born with brain damage is 1st U.S. case tied to infectionGrapefruit juice interaction with drugs can be deadlyBest before dates and expiry dates: 5 things you may not knowDon't MissHEALTHY NEW YEAR10 things you likely won't need for better health in 2016Human cloningHuman cloning possible but remains 'abhorrent' in minds of publicGeriatric healthWeight training may fix age-related 'potholes' in brain's highwaysMENTAL HEALTHSuicide attempts and insurance: Why you might not be coveredInherited diseaseGene editing of sperm and eggs clinically irresponsible, scientists sayAIDSHIV prevention pill called a game changer, but cost still a barrierDietChocolate health myths dissolveSWEETENERSAgave, stevia sweeteners to be used with caution, dietitian advisesAnalysisHow pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drugSUGARSugar causes hyperactivity in kids: A myth persisting for decadesFighting the fluFlu shot's 'crystal ball' science still our best defenceHealth or Hype?Cosmetics marketing focuses on 'fairy dust' ingredients that change nothingNutritionVitamins from A to Zinc: A reality checkSexual desireFlibanserin, 'female Viagra,' distracts from real causes of low libido: criticsExplore CBCCBC HomeTVRadioNewsSportsMusicArtsKidsLocalDocumentariesComedyBooksParentsAboriginalWeatherCBC ConnectsDigital ArchivesGamesContestsSite MapStay ConnectedMobileRSSPodcastsNewsletters & AlertsServices and InformationCorporate InfoPublic AppearancesCommercial ServicesReuse & PermissionTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCBC ShopHelpContact UsJobsDoing Business with UsRenting FacilitiesCBCRadio-CanadaÂ©2016 CBC/Radio-Canada.
