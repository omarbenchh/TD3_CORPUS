The number of incidents rose from 16 in 2004 to 47 in 2011."Everybody is aware of the risk of cell phones and texting in automobiles, but I see more and more teens distracted with the latest devices and headphones in their ears," lead author Dr. Richard Lichenstein said. "Unfortunately, as we make more and more enticing devices, the risk of injury from distraction and blocking out other sounds increases."More On This...Headphone-wearing pedestrians in increasing dangerThe study, published in the journal Injury Prevention, found that young men were most at risk, with 68 percent of the 116 victims being male and 67 percent under the age of 30.Lichenstein and his team said that the distraction of the music causes "inattentional blindness," when multiple stimuli fed to the brain divide its mental resource allocation.AdvertisementTrending in Health15 health foods that aren't worth the money2Cancer doctor thanks Bowie for helping people face death3Man dies after taking part in botched French clinical trial4Texas teen unexpectedly dies hours after stomachache5Woman has catfish removed from stomachSee all TrendsTop Health CentersMoreBack PainCancerDepressionHeart DiseasePain ManagementSexual HealthBeauty & SkinCold and FluDigestive HealthNutritionPregnancySite IndexSectionsHomeVideoPoliticsU.S.OpinionEntertainmentTechScienceHealthTravelLifestyleWorldSportsWeatherOn AirToolsLive VideoTrendingNewslettersAlertsMobilePodcastsRadioFox News StoreApps & DownloadsAboutOn Air PersonalitiesCareersCollege StudentsFox Around the WorldAdvertise With UsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesContact UsEmail NewsroomFAQMedia RelationsClosed Captioning PolicyFollowFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInRSSNewslettersFox NewsBack to TopThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2015 FOX News Network, LLC.
