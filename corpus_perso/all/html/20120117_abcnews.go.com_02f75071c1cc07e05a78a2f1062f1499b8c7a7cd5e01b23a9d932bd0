The firm responsible for the botched billing, PHY Services, was reportedly inundated with complaints and has since apologized."If you are calling with respect the billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement," said a recording for concerned callers, "you will be receiving a new statement shortly."PHY is blaming the mistake on a "system error" that resulted in the bill's invoice number being mistakenly placed in the "amount due" field.As for Rodriguez, he owes no more than $300 for outpatient services.Join the DiscussionPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.blog comments powered by DisqusHot Right Now1Best Lines of the Democratic Debate2Bill Clinton Question 'Annoys' Bernie Sanders3SpaceX Rocket Landing: What Went Wrong4Two Stars to Boycott 2016 Oscars5Police Officer Found Dead, Suspect in CustodyYou Might Also Like...Photo GalleriesView: Pet Owners Bring Their Animals to Be Blessed in SpainLifestyleView: This Week in Pictures: Top Photos from Around the GlobeInternationalView: Coolest Cars and Concepts at Detroit Auto ShowBusinessView: London Gets Lit UpInternationalView: Operation Desert Storm Remembered 25 Years LaterInternationalSee It, Share ItWLS-TVFather of Slain Journalist a 'Mess' After Losing Second ChildAP PhotoChris Christie's Beef With Michelle Obama's Healthy Eating InitiativeMichael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesA Look Back at the Life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Samir Hussein/Getty Images62 People Have the Same Wealth as Half of World's Population, Report SaysB Bartlett/GasBuddyPrice for Gas Hit 47 Cents in MichiganMic Smith/AP PhotoBest Lines of the Democratic DebateMichael Dodge/Getty ImagesTop Tennis Star Says He Was Offered $200K to Fix a MatchYahoo!-ABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsTerms of UseContact Us© 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures.
