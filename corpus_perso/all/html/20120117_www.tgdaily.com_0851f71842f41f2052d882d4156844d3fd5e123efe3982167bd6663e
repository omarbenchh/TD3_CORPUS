These conditions could favor the kind of gene swapping that creates new variations of the influenza virus, say the scientists.More worryingly, changes in migration don't just alter the pattern of contact among bird species. They can also change the ways that birds come into contact with domestic animals such as pigs - and it was gene-swapping between avian and pig flu viruses that's believed to have triggered the 2009 swine flu pandemic.View the discussion thread.Harvard flow battey could help bolster wind and solarSynaptic transistor learns while it computesWill Twitter become a big TV screen?Video: Robotic insects take to the skiesHarvard researchers showcase mind-controlled rodentsSee more about:Health Featuresbirdscolumbiaharvardinfluenzala ninamigrationswine fluMan makes his own iPad MicroSIM - using a meat cleaverYouPorn, iPad’s killer appWorld's hottest female hacker appears in NYC courtGlobal temperatures now highest for thousands of yearsHumans have unique brain structuresSingle mutation brought many East Asian traitsMethane explosions power these soft jumping robotsAre Google searches racist?Flu set to worsen, thanks to climate changeDinosaur challenges theories of early flightThe early bird catches... the crabBrain implant lets quadriplegic woman feed herselfBestcoveryBest LED LCD TVBest AV Receiver OverallBest Digital SLR Camera OverallBest Netbook OverallBest Wireless Router OverallMore...About TG DailyAdvertisingTerms of UseLegalPrivacyNewsletterLast 7 DaysImage GalleriesNewsNetworkingMusicFitnessBestcovery© 2016 Velum Media.
