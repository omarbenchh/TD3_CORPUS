They wanted to know whether folate - the naturally occurring version of folic acid - could help reduce levels of depression.''Folate had no effect on whether people were more or less depressed,'' said one of the study's authors, Helen Christensen, professor of Mental Health Research at the University of New South Wales.However, there was an effect on cognitive decline.Advertisement''We found that those people who were taking folate did not seem to show the same level of cognitive change as those that were not taking folate,'' she said.Professor Christensen said using folate and Vitamin B12 was an inexpensive way for people to improve memory function.''I didn't expect that such a small dose of folate supplement would have such an effect on cognitive levels,'' she said.TweetPin Itsubmit to redditEmail articlePrintAdvertisementMost popular1Click here for first-round offersContains:2Concerns lung cancer screening for smokers may do ...Contains:3Bomber drug ban a setback for Indigenous progress ...Contains:4Victoria government launches Wye River rebuildContains:5Thousands of older people exploring 'rational ...Contains:HuffPost AustraliaGovernment Ministers Downplay Talk Of An Early ElectionHuffPost Australia external siteAussie Matthew Dellavedova Named Basketball's Dirtiest PlayerHuffPost Australia external siteFeatured advertisersSpecial offersView these special deals by Mozo.AdvertisementReal EstateLooking to purchase your first home?
