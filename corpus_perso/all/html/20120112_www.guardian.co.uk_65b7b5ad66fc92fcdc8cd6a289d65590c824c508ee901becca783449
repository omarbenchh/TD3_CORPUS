"But the existing EU legal framework fails to recognise that periodic revalidation and requirements to participate in continuing professional development vary significantly across member states."The increased mobility of health professionals in the EU has highlighted huge variations both in the practical abilities of professionals of similar grades, and in the systems set up to ensure quality, in different member states."The doctors' letter adds: "We continue to be concerned about the future of medical training – acute medical training, in particular – and the effect of the European working time directive on acute medical and surgical trainees, which reduces the number of hours available for them to train. We call for flexibility at a European and a national level with regard to how on-call time and compensatory rest for trainees are calculated."The letter is likely to infuriate the European commission, which is already proposing some changes to the rules governing free movement of labour within the EU, partly in response to the storm that followed the Guardian's revelations of similar concerns over patient safety raised by medical regulators and GPs in 2009.But many professional bodies in the UK do not think these go far enough. Before Christmas, the General Medical Council (GMC), the regulator for doctors, warned that EU doctors would still be able to register in the UK without being tested on their English or medical competence.The health secretary, Andrew Lansley, is strengthening the powers of NHS employers to check on medics' language skills under measures not bound by EU laws, but the GMC warned it would first have to recognise doctors' qualifications without giving them the same checks that were applied when doctors from other parts of the world sought work.The commission says that existing EU rules, including on language skills, were agreed by all member states and, if applied correctly, protect patients and do not endanger their safety. Problems in some member states have been, or are being, rectified by national systems without changes to EU law, it says.However, the commission recognises the need to "clarify and slightly amend" some aspects of EU rules and is now doing so.More newsTopicsDoctorsHealthGPsNHSEuropean UnionEuropeShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppReuse this contentmore on this storyThree-quarters of GPs want health and social care bill withdrawn, poll revealsMost doctors surveyed say the Royal College of GPs and other medical groups should call for the bill to be scrappedPublished: 12 Jan 2012Three-quarters of GPs want health and social care bill withdrawn, poll revealsManagement consultants get £7m to give GPs business skillsPublished: 12 Jan 2012Management consultants get £7m to give GPs business skillsSurgeons get better – then worse – with age, says French studyPublished: 11 Jan 2012Surgeons get better – then worse – with age, says French studyAndrew Lansley backs plan for NHS staff to question patients on lifestylesPublished: 10 Jan 2012Andrew Lansley backs plan for NHS staff to question patients on lifestylesDoctors issue warning over facial fillersPublished: 7 Jan 2012Doctors issue warning over facial fillerspopularThe Guardianback to tophomeUK selectedworldsportfootballopinionculturebusinesslifestylefashionenvironmenttechtravelall sectionsclosehomeUK selectededucationmediasociety selectedlawscotlandwalesnorthern irelandworldeuropeUSamericasasiaaustraliaafricamiddle eastcitiesdevelopmentsportfootballcricketrugby unionF1tennisgolfcyclingboxingracingrugby leaguefootballlive scorestablescompetitionsresultsfixturesclubsopinioncolumnistsculturefilmtv & radiomusicgamesbooksart & designstageclassicalbusinesseconomicsbankingretailmarketseurozonelifestylefoodhealth & fitnesslove & sexfamilywomenhome & gardenfashionenvironmentclimate changewildlifeenergypollutiontechtravelUKeuropeUSskiingmoneypropertysavingspensionsborrowingcareersscienceprofessional networksthe observertoday's papereditorials & lettersobituariesg2weekendthe guidesaturday reviewsunday's papercommentthe new reviewobserver magazinemembershipcrosswordsblogeditorquickcrypticprizequipticgeniusspeedyeverymanazedvideoUK News›Society›DoctorsFacebookTwitterFacebookTwitterall topicsall contributorssolve technical issuecomplaints & correctionsterms & conditionsprivacy policycookie policysecuredrop© 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
