It provides the first direct evidence of how alcohol makes people feel good.''Researchers scanned the brains of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 non-drinkers immediately after they drank alcohol. Their findings, published in the Science Translational Medicine journal, showed alcohol caused endorphins to be released in the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex regions.In all of the volunteers, larger quantities of endorphins released in the nucleus accumbens were linked to increased feelings of pleasure. Increased levels of endorphins released in the orbitofrontal cortex were linked to a greater feeling of intoxication in heavy drinkers, but not in non-drinkers.Dr Mitchell said: ''This indicates that the brains of heavy or problem drinkers are changed in a way that makes them more likely to find alcohol pleasant, and may be a clue to how problem drinking develops in the first place. That greater feeling of reward might cause them to drink too much.''With TELEGRAPH16 commentsWhat's with the cartoon? Has The Age signed up with the temperance movement? There's nothing wrong with having a few drinks. The vast majority of people learn when to stop - although it takes a few years for some to learn.CommenterGreg PlattLocationBrunswickDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:13AMExcercise and laughter takes effort. Drinking is easier, just go to a pub or Dan Murphy, get a block and get drunk.CommentersbobbyLocationmelbourneDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:14AMIt is no wonder many people turn to alcohol to ease their misery; the world in which we work today has removed all workers' rights; no annual leave with pay, no sick leave with pay, and you get penalised on public holidays as they are not paid for either. Human nature being what it is, we have to find relaxation and release from stress somehow! So what if it's alcohol? I drink a glass of wine every night with dinner, and on a Friday night I might make it two, to celebrate getting through another week of corporate slavery.Commentercorporate casual slaveLocationthis rotten worldDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:22AMDon't know what planet your on, but here on Earth people get paid for work they do, not for staying away from a job.CommenterThe Write StuffLocationMelbourneDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 12:49PMYes about time my workplace realised that my regular shots of whisky throughout the morning make me happier and therefore a more pleasurable person to work with. Do they really want me to stop this habit and turn me into a miserable git due to some bizarre societal conventions?CommenterConformer with a CauseLocationAir Traffic ControlDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:26AMSo it took a bunch of uni researchers to work out that alcohol makes people feel better? Wow!CommentershempLocationmelbDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:28AMJust scanned the article briefly, key takeaway point is Alcohol is the same as Exercise, right?I'll be doing a few reps tonight!CommenterRossDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:32AMTrust an article on booze to bring out the Herald Sun readers here (with their usual level of intelligence).@Corporate casual slave - you're a casual you moron. Want all those perks? Become full time. Casuals have ALWAYS had less benefits than full time and for a reason.@shemp - I can see how you missed some of those big words so let me break it down for you; scientists were looking at the exact regions of the brain and what endorphins were released, not just ticking a box on a clipboard labelled "feels good".CommenterDrinking isn't the only thing that kills brain cellsDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 8:52AMThank you for clearing it up, and OMG, wait a minute, this is the Age, and here I was thinking that I was reading the Temperance Movement Weekly Newsletter..........(big word that...Weekly)CommentershempLocationmelbDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 9:36AMWhy bother promoting alcohol? There are far better* intoxicants out there. Let's see more research effort thrown into them, and then more drug policy based on evidence and rationality. Our current laws in this area rely on ignorance and prejudice for their popularity. This is deliberately so, in order to protect the interests of corrupt officials & organised criminals who collude to make themselves an obscene killing out of the prohibition racket. Disinformation is their primary tool toward this end.* 'better' in this case meaning less damaging - both to the individual and society, more pleasant and generally worthwhile partaking of.CommenterDepartment of Free ChoiceLocationMelbourneDate and timeJanuary 13, 2012, 9:08AMMore commentsComments are now closedTweetPin Itsubmit to redditEmail articlePrintAdvertisementMost popular1Donald Trump, troll politics and how to win at ...Contains:total comments52ACCC fines Kogan $32,400 for dodgy discountingContains:3Behind the scenes with Face Swap Live, the latest ...Contains:4Foursquare poised for comeback after years of ...Contains:5The most futuristic predictions that came true in ...Contains:HuffPost AustraliaSexting, Allergies And Diabetes Projects Seek Support On New Crowdfunding PlatformHuffPost Australia external siteThe Sweetest Valentine's Day Gift With A Salty TwistHuffPost Australia external siteFollow UsDigital LifeNetflix's geo-blocking crackdown is doomed to fail, ...Posted in: Gadgets-On-The-GoDate: Jan 16, 2016, 5:23AMCommentsIt's good news for the 4726 anonymous Australians on the ...Posted in: Gadgets-On-The-GoDate: Dec 18, 2015, 8:49AMCommentsThe da Vinci Jr makes 3D printing more affordable than ...Posted in: Gadgets-On-The-GoDate: Dec 17, 2015, 11:37AMCommentsFeatured advertisersCompare & SaveDealsComparePopularGoogle NEXUS 6P $60/Mth on OptusGoogle NEXUS 6P starting at $60/Month Min.
