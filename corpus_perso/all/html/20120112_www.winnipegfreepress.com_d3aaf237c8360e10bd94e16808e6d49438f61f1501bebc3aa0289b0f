Sharing the same basic uni-body chassis, the Cougar featured a three-inch longer wheelbase, different spring rates for a smoother ride and increased leg and trunk room over the Mustang. With an overall length of 190-inches it was more than six inches longer than the Mustang. Unless the two were side-by-side it was hard to tell the Cougar was a larger car. It was the Cougar's styling, however, that really brought the package together. The Cougar certainly didn't go unnoticed -- it received Motor Trend magazine's car of the year award for 1967 and accounted for almost half of Mercury sales for 1967. | With the 1967 model making such a great entry, Mercury didn't mess with success and only offered mild styling changes for 1968 with the inclusion of side marker lamps, dual hydraulic braking system with warning light, four-way emergency flashers, padded dash and sun visors, along with two-speed windshield wipers and washers as standard equipment. | In 1969, the second-generation Cougar emerged.

I always rinse my dishes before I load them, but some of them come out with a film. I ran the dishwasher and put vinegar in it but still have cloudy glassware. I have just steeped the glasses in a sink with vinegar, but this hasn't helped. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks, Marie, Niverville | Answer: Typically, etching or fogginess occurs due to one of the following reasons: too much detergent; lack of rinse aid; an overloaded dishwasher; overly hot water temperature; lack of water softener on hard-water systems; or the detergent is not compatible with the machine. | To remove mild etching, head to the nearest pharmacy and ask for citric acid. Put cups into the dishwasher and add citric acid to the soap dispenser. Run the cycle as usual and if the etching stays, it is likely permanent. You can also soak cups in vinegar and rub them with fine steel wool. Don't get too excited if at first the glasses look brand new, because the etching may return when the glasses dry. I have heard positive results regarding phosphate-free Palmolive Gel Dishwasher Detergent (Lemon Splash Scent). However, you may need to experiment with a few different brands. | Question: I have a pair of black boots that are turning my socks or stockings black.

For seed companies, though, the biggest challenge is keeping up with demand from consumers who are eager to snap up new or old favourites and hard-to-find heritage varieties for starting seeds indoors. | If seeds aren't being sown until late March or early April, why the rush and excitement to order seeds? Like restaurant menus, glossy seed catalogues are fun to read even if you already know what you are planning to order. Part of the attraction, says Tanya Stefanec, owner of Heritage Harvest Seed in Carman, is that once the seed packet is in your hand, dreams of summer begin and the long winter seems shorter. | Stefanec fields requests from all over Canada for her heirloom seeds, many of them rare collectibles.  Stefanec says varieties suitable for growing in patio pots are more popular this year than ever. She's excited to have acquired a tiny cukemelon that is no more than 10 centimetres across that has every appearance of a miniature watermelon. Also known as Mexican Sour Gherkin, it can be grown on a trellis in a patio pot and has a refreshing cucumber-like taste with a hint of citrus. Perfect, Stefanec says, for snacking, salads or pickling. | If your taste buds are yearning for the hot flavour of fresh-grown peppers, Stefanec recommends Hungarian Hot Wax peppers. Well suited to our short growing season, she says these are great for pickling and making your own hot banana peppers.","last_updated":"2016-01-16T09:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*750/7559687.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","id":365520021,"author":"Mike Moore","title":"Winnipeg Renovation Show on now","last_modified":"2016-01-16T08:06:55.000Z","image_type":"noimage","path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"","content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"","our_rating":"","image":"","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","image_dimensions":"","cost":27,"section":"Homes","url":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/content_id-365520021/","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"","publish_time":"2016-01-16T09:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"Today and Sunday are the final two days of the Winnipeg Renovation Show at the RBC Convention Centre.

If you're a collector, it's even more important to showcase your items in the best possible way. There are standard display cabinets made for such items but there are lots of other unique ways to make a statement. | Placing like items together brings a sense of importance to the vignette. If items are placed individually around the house, they would be shrinking violets and not really noticeable -- table clutter, basically.

One day I decided to group them all together on top of my old piano and instantly I had a lovely collection. When they were all lit, the vignette was quite stunning. When they were placed individually around the house, they were lost in the crowd. Think about what items you may have that are similar that can make a stunning statement when grouped together. You may have a collection of quirky photo frames in different colours, styles and shapes that, when grouped together or hung on the wall, might make a stunning display. Maybe you have a small collection of vintage hand mirrors that could be hung on the wall instead of hidden in a drawer. Hats are another item that might make a great grouping -- cowboy, straw, vintage or whatever. Once you have at least three of an item, you're on your way to an interesting collection and display. | People who collect books know how easily the collection can get out of hand. Look for new ways to incorporate books into your decor by creating interesting displays. Place books under glass using a covered cake plate and dome. Install sturdy shelves over doorways to house and display books. Hang cube shelves of varying sizes to display books on the wall. This would be a good idea in a child's room as well.","last_updated":"2016-01-16T08:06:41.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*908/7563966.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":365520041,"author":"","title":"SOLD

																																									<p>The province will give $555,000 to the Alzheimer Society of Manitoba (ASM) over the next three years to support the new First Link program that helps families affected by Alzheimer's disease, Premier Greg Selinger said today.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>First Link brings services and supports to people affected by Alzheimer's disease or related dementia as soon as possible after diagnosis. Supports include information, support groups, education sessions and referral to other health agencies or resources. While physicians and health-care providers can make referrals to First Link, individuals and their families can also contact ASM directly.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>More than 19,000 Manitobans have Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. In 2011 alone, more than 4,300 Manitobans over 65 developed Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia.</p>																															
										
										
																																									<p>To access First Link, contact ASM directly at 204-943-6622, toll-free at 1-800-378-6699 or online at <a href="http://www.alzheimer.mb.ca/">www.alzheimer.mb.ca/</a>.</p>
