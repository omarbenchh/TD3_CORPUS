A team of plastic surgeons performed a split skin graft on her upper arm and then attached her hand to her groin in a procedure known as a “groin flap”.The healthy skin in her groin area assisted with skin growth and blood flow in her hand damaged by the snake’s poison which had spread through the tissue.“The skin on her upper arm is healing beautifully. In two weeks’ time we will know if the skin on her hand has taken successfully.“We are very confident that the procedure was a success,” Marais said.Mikayla’s grandmother, Charmaine Robbertse, said on Wednesday that Mikayla was back to her old self.“She is walking around, playing princess and colouring in. She is a real busy bee,” Robbertse said.Robbertse said Mikayla understood that she had to keep her arm as still as possible. “I’m trying to entertain her (with) DVDs on my laptop. Kung Fu Panda and Barbie are her favourites.”Mikayla’s grandfather Bertus will this weekend see her for the first time after her surgery. He had to return to their Lephalale farm last week.“He is so excited. He will not believe his eyes when he sees how well she is doing,” Robbertse said.Mikayla was bitten by a cobra on her hand and elbow on the family farm 8km outside Lephalale soon after going to bed on December 19.She was taken to the state hospital in Lephalale and treated with antivenom before being transferred to Steve Biko hospital. - Pretoria NewsBy: YOLANDE DU PREEZto classic siteSpecial FeaturesThe Zuma EraMost ReadZuma threatens to spill the beans‘Blacks more racist than whites’Gareth Cliff suing M-Net for R25mSpeed blamed for soccer star’s crashDJ’s son ‘drugged’ on trip to varsityFront PageDA racists paid for Zuma billboard: ANC‘She killed my last son’This is Africa’s North Korea‘Richest 62 own as much as half the world’'Should I let my daughter fail?'Editor's ChoiceIs the AU bold enough to tackle Belmokhtar?How Proteas rebuffed BodiMashaba’s just another DA election gimmickListen to your body, not the packWhat makes a weary traveller happy?MORE news/south-africa/gautengNEWSCall for smooth start at Gauteng varsitiesGauteng university vice-chancellors have collectively called for a “smooth start to the academic year”.3 hours agoNEWSUniversity registrations resumeUnisa, Pretoria University and Witwatersrand University resumed registrations on Monday.6 hours agoNEWS‘Kamo tweets were driven by anger’Khuthi Makananise took the country by storm when she fabricated a brutal murder and rape story about a friend.8 hours agoNEWSDali Mpofu to represent Gareth CliffEFF chairman Advocate Dali Mpofu is set to represent axed Idols SA judge Gareth Cliff in his R25m lawsuit against M-Net.9 hours agoNEWSUP strikers vow to defy subpoena#OutsourcingMustFall protesters at the University of Pretoria are demanding permanent positions and better salaries or protests will continue.11 hours agoNEWSGareth Cliff lawsuit: M-Net given deadlineM-Net has until 2pm to announce a decision regarding axed Idols SA judge Gareth Cliff, his lawyer has said.11 hours agoNEWSNew R4m bus stolen, then recoveredPolice are on the hunt for four bogus cops who hijacked a luxury bus worth an estimated R4 million.12 hours agoNEWSIpid probes suicide at police stationIpid is investigating the case of a woman who allegedly used the chain from a roller door to hang herself at Linden police station.12 hours agoMORE NEWS/SOUTH-AFRICA/GAUTENG
