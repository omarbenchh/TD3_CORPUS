People with COPD often experience a worsening of their breathlessness and other symptoms (exacerbations) throughout the course of their disease.But vitamin D doesn’t seem to reduce the number of these exacerbations. That said, vitamin D did benefit a small group of 30 people in the study who had severely low vitamin D levels when the study began.The new findings appear in the Annals of Internal Medicine.Low Vitamin D Levels and COPDVitamin D is often referred to as the sunshine vitamin because our bodies produce it when exposed to sunlight. The Institute of Medicine recommends that people aged 1 to 70 take in 600 international units (IUs) of vitamin D per day, and people older than 70 should aim for 800 IUs. Some foods like fish and fortified dairy and juice products are rich in vitamin D, but supplements are also used to raise blood levels.The new study included 182 people with COPD. Participants orally received 100,000 IU of vitamin D or an inactive placebo monthly for a year. There were 468 exacerbations during the study period, and there was no difference in the numbers between the different groups. There were also no differences in time to the first exacerbation between those who received vitamin D and those who did not.People who took vitamin D did not report greater improvements in their quality of life or the number of times they were hospitalized for COPD, the study shows. Vitamin D also had no bearing on their lung function and risk of death.However, in looking at a small subset of people with severely low vitamin D, the rate of exacerbations decreased among people who received vitamin D, the study showed. But the researchers note that the number of people in their study with severely low vitamin D was very small, so future studies to look at a possible benefit from vitamin D in people with severely low vitamin D levels need to be done to support the findings.1|2Next Page >Continue reading below...Top PicksSlideshow: COPD Warning SignsBronchitis: When to Call a DoctorMyths and Facts About COPD10 Exercises For People With COPDEating Right With COPDWhat Is 'Walking Pneumonia'?Further Reading:Slideshow: Super Foods for Your BonesSlideshow: The Truth About Vitamin DVitamin D Deficiency: Symptoms, Causes, and Health RisksFood Science for Your Heart: Functional FoodsVitamin D: Vital Role in Your HealthWhat Is the Female Athlete Triad?Are You Getting Enough Vitamin D?See All Vitamin D TopicsLung Disease & Respiratory Health CenterBronchitisCOPDEmphysemaPneumoniaNews & FeaturesQuizzesSlideshowsVideosReferenceFind a PulmonologistRelated to Lung Disease & Respiratory HealthAllergiesAsthmaCold, Flu & CoughCystic FibrosisLung CancerPulmonary HypertensionSmoking CessationTuberculosisToday on WebMDSymptoms of 'Walking Pneumonia'You may not even know you have it.Pulmonary EmbolismSigns of this potentially fatal complication.Persistent Cough?When a cold becomes bronchitis.What Is Pleurisy?Causes behind painful breathing, fluid buildup.Slideshow7 Warning Signs of COPDSLIDESHOWA Visual Overview of BronchitisQUIZCOPD Myths and FactsSLIDESHOWEnergy-Boosting Foods for COPDArticleWhat Is Pulmonary Fibrosis?Article4 Causes of EmphysemaArticleWhy Am I Coughing Up Blood?Article6 Types of Lung DiseasesWebMD Special SectionsLearning More About Your Lung HealthWorking With Your CF Care Team: How to Move Up to Adult CareA Visual Guide to COPDIdiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and Your LungsHealth Solutions From Our SponsorsIBS-C Symptoms?Ringing in the EarsCancer SupportAbout Your CancerExercise & OA Knee PainCML Treatment PlanAortic Valve Stenosis?New Way to Take InsulinDiagnosed with Cancer?Hearing Loss TestManaging CancerHelp with Painful KneesFrequent Constipation?Feeding a Growing WorldQuestions About HemophiliaMore From WebMD:Hemophilia Treatment|RA Basics|Psoriasis|MS Assessment|Hemophilia Questions|Preteen Vaccines|ADHD in Children|Diabetes Diet|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma |Breast Cancer|Toenail Fungus|Incontinence|COPDFind us on:URAC: Accredited Health Web SiteAdChoicesAbout WebMDAdvertise With UsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySponsor PolicySite MapCareersContact UsMedscape ReferenceeMedicineHealthRxListMedscapeMedicineNetBootsWebMDWebMD CorporateWebMD Health ServicesFirst AidWebMD MagazineWebMD Health RecordWebMD MobileNewslettersDictionaryPhysician Directory©2005-2016 WebMD, LLC.
