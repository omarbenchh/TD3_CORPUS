Obesity, poor diet and excessive alcohol consumption continue to be a cause of unacceptable levels of ill health, which are inequitably distributed across society."The report also highlighted a 28% decline in the premature mortality rate, the rate of death from all causes in people under 75. The proportion fell from 507 per 100,000 people in 1995 to 365 per 100,000 in 2009.Premature deaths as a result of cancer fell by 22% over the same period, heart disease deaths were down 60% and deaths from stroke were down 54%.Several factors were attributed to the reductions, such as early detection, better treatment and better organisation of care.Sir Harry also highlighted the benefits of helping people to help themselves, which suggests people are healthier when they are given the skills and knowledge to take control of their own lives.He said: "If we are to make a significant impact on the incidence of ill health in Scotland, we need to pay attention to the ways in which we create health."Sir Harry added: "There is willingness in Scotland to embrace new thinking in our efforts to narrow health inequalities, and make Scotland a better place to grow and develop."If we can capitalise on this positive mindset, we can make changes which may result in significant improvements to the health and well-being of all Scots."For NHS-approved information on a number of health topics including alcohol, obesity and smoking-related issues visit the STV Health Centre.What do you think?Please Sign in or Join to leave a comment.
