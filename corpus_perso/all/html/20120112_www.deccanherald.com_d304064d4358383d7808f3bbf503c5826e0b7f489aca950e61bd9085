After intervention, 57 per cent in canola group and 66 per cent in olive group showed no liver fat. This is statistically significant,” Anoop Misra, a former professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences who is now associated with Fortis Hospital, said.Misra along with colleagues from Command Hospital, Bangalore, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi, Government MH College of Home Science and Science for Women in Jabalpur and AIIMS conducted the research, which later would also look into the genetics of liver fat in Indians.The participants in the study were made to use olive and canola – supplied by a business house that funded the research – for six months and followed up in the next six months. Olive Pomace oil, which has higher heating point and good for Indian style cooking, was used.As many as 80 per cent obese have excess liver fat, which is dangerous as it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer, while 15 to 20 per cent non-obese persons also has liver fat. The excess fat could trigger heart attack, stroke and diabetes.Even though canola and olive are expensive, the health benefits come from healthy mono-unsaturated fatty acid, which these oils have aplenty. Canola has good quantity of omega-3 fatty acid too, which is good for heart.Misra made it clear that the new trial is not for categorising cooking oils on the basis of its health benefits and common Indian oils like mustard and rice barn oils too have their own advantages.The worst, however, is coconut oil, palm oil and butter fat. “It is best to use a combination of cooking oils in a limited quantity,” he said.Go to TopTweetVideosEmerging frontiers in journalism: A conversation with...Republic Day flower show at LalbaghNew helmet rule: Safety or inconvenienceWoman throws ink on KejriwalSubscribe - Deccan Herald's YouTube channelmore videosMost Popular Stories nowCommentedEmailedViewedAamir Khan's film 'Dangal' deserves 'treatment': BJP leaderInfra woes driving IT firms out of CityJamia Milia Islamia not a minority institution: AG'Nobel winner's views on homoeopathy baseless'Video clip shows CM slapping officer in publicCentre may target Sisodia, Jain; claims KejriwalWoman throws ink at KejriwalIt's all in the mindIndra Nooyi becomes Yale's biggest alumni donorA career option that has evolvedDetachable plane invented to save lives during plane crashes'Many challenges in AI, but possibilities are endless'Salt caves to battle respiratory problemsOf a paradise lostIndian-origin doc in US arrested after deaths of 36 patientsSRK used to stand outside my dance classes for Gauri: ShiamakIndra Nooyi becomes Yale's biggest alumni donorKabir Bedi marries partner Parveen Dusanj on 70th birthdayUnion minister Bandaru Dattatreya booked over Dalit student's suicideISIS recruit lists his job skills on LinkedIn!Paying more for nothingPhoto GalleryDelhi CM Arvind Kejriwal being greeted by a civil defence volunteer at a 'thanksgiving rally...Students and parents take part in the Visheshtarigage Vishesta Mela in Mangaluru...Health officials administer polio vaccine drops to children at a government hospital in Jammu...Indian Navy ships during a demonstration as part of Navy day celebrations, off the Chennai coast...Rajasthani dolls are seen displayed on Sedam road in Kalburg...Students performs a skill during the annual day function of Bhonsala Militry School...Models displays designer Vikram Phadnis collection...Amitabh Bachchan with designer Vikram Phadnis (R) and Shilpa Marigold at a function...Commandos contingent during a rehearsal for the Republic Day parade at Vijay Chowk in New Delhi...5th International Kite Festival - 2016 organised by Rotary Clubs of Zone IV Mangaluru...moreAbout Us | News | Business | Sports | Supplements | Contact Us | Subscribe | Privacy PolicyCopyright 2014, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd., 75, M.G Road, Post Box 5331, Bengaluru - 560001Tel: +91 (80) 25880000 Fax No. +91 (80) 25880523
