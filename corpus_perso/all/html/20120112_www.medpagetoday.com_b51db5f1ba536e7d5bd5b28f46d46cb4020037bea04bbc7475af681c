Claire Wang, MD, ScD, of Columbia University in New York City, and colleagues.Although those numbers may seem inconsequential, over 10 years the result would be 2.4 million fewer person-years of diabetes, 95,000 fewer cases of coronary heart disease, 26,000 fewer deaths, and a health-related cost savings of $17 billion, the researchers reported.Moreover, the tax could be expected to generate some $13 billion in revenue, they observed.Given the "monumental role" of increased taxes on reducing tobacco consumption, Wang and colleagues constructed a model in which they calculated the projected impact of a penny-per-ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened drinks among U.S. adults.They estimated that this tax would result in a 15% decrease (95% CI 6 to 24) in consumption of sweetened beverages by adults ages 25 to 64.The effects would be particularly striking in men. The projected 1.3 lb average weight loss for those ages 25 to 44 would be associated with a 3.4% decrease in diabetes, 22,000 fewer cases of coronary heart disease, and 4,000 fewer premature deaths. For men ages 45 to 64, a weight loss of only 0.7 lb could result in a 2.3% decrease in diabetes, 54,000 fewer cases of heart disease, and 15,000 fewer deaths.The researchers noted that their model is based on certain assumptions, such as that a 10% increase in the cost of sugary drinks would be associated with an 8% reduction in consumption, and uncertainty as to whether people would substitute other sweetened foods.They also acknowledged the likelihood of pushback by the soft drink industry, as happened when New York State attempted to impose this type of tax.The two other studies looked more closely at interventions specifically targeting diabetes.In one, Xiaohui Zhuo, PhD, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and colleagues, estimated that implementation of a nationwide community-based program could delay or prevent almost 900,000 cases of diabetes over 25 years, at a savings of $5.7 billion.Zhuo and colleagues used a simulation model to determine the outcomes if a program based on the Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial could be extended to include screening for all adults ages 18 to 84, with a lifestyle intervention for those found to be at risk.The intervention consisted of 16 group sessions during the first year and eight the second year, the goal being a loss of 5% to 7% of body weight.The researchers estimated that this intervention would lead to a 40% reduction in risk for diabetes during those two years and a 10% reduction each year thereafter.The result of the intervention over a period of 25 years was a gain of 952,000 years of life and 669,000 quality-adjusted life-years, at a total cost of $24.1 billion.But there also would be a $29.8 billion long-term saving in costs for treatment of the 885,000 people who would have developed diabetes and its complications, for an overall saving of $5.7 billion.The researchers acknowledged that employers might be unwilling to take on the insurance burden to implement the program. "In the context of the current U.S. reimbursement system, it might be necessary for all health insurers to participate and share prevention costs if implementation were to be successful," wrote Zhuo and colleagues.The third report was a meta-analysis of studies that looked at outcomes for the Diabetes Prevention Program."The Diabetes Prevention Program trial established that weight loss was the single most important factor in reducing diabetes incidence -- for every kilogram of weight loss, diabetes incidence was reduced by 16%," wrote Mohammed K. Ali, MBChB, and colleagues from Emory University in Atlanta.However, the intervention in that trial was costly, and a number of subsequent studies have examined lower cost approaches adapted from the original intervention.The 28 studies analyzed by Ali's group included 2,916 participants who averaged 55 years of age and whose mean body mass index was 34.The majority were white women.At one year, the mean weight loss was −3.99% of body weight (95% CI −5.16 to −2.83).Similar degrees of weight loss were seen with different ways of delivering the implementation:By health professionals, −4.27% (95% CI −5.85 to −2.70)By lay educators, −3.15% (95% CI −5.46 to −0.83)Through electronic media, −4.20% (95% CI −7.62 to −0.77)"Our finding that lay community members are as effective at motivating weight loss as higher-salaried professionals has enormous importance for the scalability and economic sustainability of diabetes interventions," observed Ali and colleagues.Studies in which there were more group sessions were associated with greater weight loss, with an increased loss of 0.26% for each additional session.Costs associated with the intervention ranged from $934 in programs that included six group sessions to $1,075 for programs with 16 sessions.Key to the success of a nationwide diabetes prevention effort will be increasing public awareness about diabetes, developing "structured, sustainable, and effective programs," and maintaining weight loss motivation and momentum in participants, according to the researchers."Meanwhile, the rigorous pursuit of innovative diabetes risk-reduction policies and systems to link high-risk groups to effective and affordable diabetes prevention programs must continue," Ali and colleagues stated.Wang's study was supported by the American Heart Asssociation Western States Affiliate and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.The authors of the three studies had no relevant financial disclosures.Reviewed by Robert Jasmer, MD Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco and Dorothy Caputo, MA, RN, BC-ADM, CDE, Nurse PlannerPrimary SourceHealth AffairsSource Reference: Wang Y, et al "A penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would cut health and cost burdens of diabetes" Health Affairs 2012; 31: 1-9.Secondary SourceHealth AffairsSource Reference: Zhuo X, et al "A nationwide community-based lifestyle program could delay or prevent type 2 diabetes cases and save $5.7 billion in 25 years" Health Affairs 2012; 31: 50-60.Additional SourceHealth AffairsSource Reference: Ali M, et al "How effective were lifestyle interventions in real-world settings that were modeled on the Diabetes Prevention Program?"
