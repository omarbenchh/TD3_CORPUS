With an overall length of 190-inches it was more than six inches longer than the Mustang. Unless the two were side-by-side it was hard to tell the Cougar was a larger car. It was the Cougar's styling, however, that really brought the package together.

We have removed our carpeting from our basement and now are considering what we should put in place of the carpet. We would like to put in laminate flooring, but people have told us this is not a good idea depending on moisture and that carpet tiles would be better. I'm confused. Is it OK to install laminate flooring? | Thank you, Shirley Trafton | Answer: Installing flooring on a concrete basement floor is often problematic, even in a dry basement. Condensation is always a consideration because the floor may be considerably cooler than the other basement surfaces, and special measures may have to be taken to prevent this from occurring. Laminate flooring may be a good choice, but should have subfloor protection to prevent damage from moisture. | Because the concrete slab in a basement floor is in contact with the soil beneath and touching the foundation walls at the perimeter, it may be considerably cooler than the air and surrounding surfaces in the same area. If the relative humidity (RH) is too high in the basement and air movement is stagnant, there is a high probability of condensation on the cool basement slab. If there is no floor covering on this slab, a small amount of condensation should eventually dry without any serious consequences.","last_updated":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","full_image":""},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","id":364729351,"author":"Reena Nerbas","title":"Wash vintage plastic penguin with dish soap and water","last_modified":"2016-01-09T08:05:51.000Z","image_type":"noimage","path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"","content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"","our_rating":"","image":"","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","image_dimensions":"","cost":27,"section":"Homes","url":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/content_id-364729351/","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"","publish_time":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"Question: I have an original Fisher-Price penguin pull toy from the early '70s.

After cleaning, sanitize toys: dilute one tablespoon of bleach in one gallon (four litres) water.&quot; Wash and dry toys.

Roseanne, Emerson | Answer: Cooking is an art and it sounds like your family reaps the benefits of your gifts. Here are a few ideas for well-shaped individual pancakes: spray the cookie cutter with cooking spray before use. Make sure your frying pan is flat and the batter is thin enough to pour. Fill a squeeze bottle with the batter and squeeze the batter inside the cookie cutter to reach every corner. Alternatively, pour the batter inside the pan a little larger than the cutter. After the pancake is cooked, cut shapes using the cookie cutter. Or forget the cookie cutter and use the squeeze bottle to write names or draw pictures in the frying pan. When the batter bubbles, flip the pancake.","last_updated":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","full_image":""},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":480,"id":364729331,"author":"Todd Lewys","title":"New name, same great show","last_modified":"2016-01-09T08:05:45.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":320,"path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"320x480","full_image_height":1499,"content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"7534049","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/320*480/7534049.jpg","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","cost":27,"image_dimensions":"320x480","section":"Homes","url":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/content_id-364729331/","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"1000x1499","publish_time":"2016-01-09T09:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"Newsflash: the Kitchen, Bath & Reno Show has a new name.

																																									<p>DEMOLITION work began Wednesday at the Misericordia Health Complex, the start of a $43-million development.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>A 2,272-kilogram wrecking ball was used to cave in the roof of a 106-year-old building, the Maryland South building.</p>														
										
										
																																									<figure class="inline photoswipe_slides">

									</a>
									<figcaption><p></p> <p>KEN GIGLIOTTI /  WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Crews begin demolition work at the Misericordia Health Complex Wednesday. </p></figcaption>
								</figure>
																												<p>The redevelopment will take place in two phases.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>Phase one involves replacing the demolished Maryland South building with a two-storey complex that will accommodate the Buhler Eye Centre -- the largest facility of its kind in Western Canada -- and the new University of Manitoba Ophthalmology residency program.</p>														
										
										
																																									<p>The complex's ambulatory diagnostic centre will relocate from the fourth floor to be closer to Urgent Care and Ambulatory Care.</p>																																					
										
										
																																									<p>The new complex will house PRIME, a new day health centre for the elderly.</p>														
										
										
																																									<p>Work in the first phase is expected to be completed in 2013.</p>																															
										
										
																																									<p>The second phase of the redevelopment will include demolition of the Sherbrook building and replacing it with a new chapel and spacious front entrance and two-storey glass-walled atrium</p>														
										
										
																																									<p>Wednesday's demolition was unexpectedly interrupted when the wrecking ball became wedged in the upper floors of the structure and came loose.</p>																															
										
										
																																									<p>Hospital officials said the wrecking ball was reattached and demolition crews were back to work by noon.</p>														
										
										
																																									<p>George Vincent, project superintendent, said it will take about seven weeks to completely demolish the building and clean up the site.</p>
