Improving discharge arrangements, particularly at weekends, would make a big differenceDay case surgery - Everything from hernia repairs and cataract operations to ear, nose and throat surgery can be done as a day case. But again the NHS is lagging behind international best practiceBack-office functions - By standardising and simplifying practices in areas such as HR, finance and IT, £600m could be saved from the £2.8m annual billStaffing - Money could be saved through reducing reliance on agency staff and overtime as well as tackling sickness rates through better occupational healthProcurement - The fragmented way basic goods, from gloves to paper, are bought means many places are over paying. About £500m a year - 10% of the consumables bill - could be saved if all trusts bought at the lowest available priceAnd because costs are rising at a higher rate than this, due to factors such as the ageing population and cost of new drugs, the health service is having to make the £20bn of savings.The Nuffield Trust said this was presenting a major challenge because productivity had been getting worse over the past decade.It focused on hospitals because they are the most expensive part of the NHS system, accounting for about £45bn a year - nearly half the entire budget.The think-tank compared hospital performance against international data as well as taking an in-depth look at how six trusts had turnaround performance.Judith Smith, head of policy at the Nuffield Trust, said: "It is very difficult to justify cuts if inefficiencies in areas such as rates of day case surgery, length of stay and the purchasing of hospital supplies remain untackled."The financial challenge facing the NHS will concentrate minds, but much more needs to be done."Why, when so much is known about what drives and can improve efficiency, has hospital productivity deteriorated?"David Stout, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the Nuffield Trust was "absolutely right" to flag up the need to improve productivity."The NHS has a lot to do if it is going to meet the financial challenge it faces and time is running out."Health minister Simon Burns added: "We agree the NHS should and can be more efficient and improve the quality of its services at the same time."Share this story About sharingEmailFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinMore on this storyFinance woe 'will prompt major NHS revamp'15 December 2011More hospitals need to close, says ex-NHS boss1 September 2011UK 'has too many hospital births'14 July 2011Hospital shake-up 'needed to protect patients'3 March 2011Hospitals must adapt to new world, says NHS chief25 February 2011Related Internet linksDepartment of HealthNuffield TrustThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesTop Stories1,050 jobs lost at Tata steel plantsMore than 1,000 jobs are to go at Tata steel plants - with the bulk going in Port Talbot - the company confirms.18 January 2016France soldiers die in Alps avalanche18 January 2016Trump ban 'would make him a martyr'18 January 2016FeaturesLost in translation?Is speaking English a problem for Muslim women?His boy JohnSolving the mystery of Rudyard Kipling’s sonSky spectrumWhat causes an upside-down rainbow?Who is Bill?Meet the super-smart stick man taking the internet by stormA black Nancy Drew?Rebooting old favourites with new facesBackhandersHave top tennis players been paid to lose?Rhodes dilemmaShould a controversial statue come down?Undone by modernityThe last practitioners of India's dying professionsBig decision'Being pregnant was always going to be risky for me'News navigationSectionsHomeUKUK HomeEnglandN.
