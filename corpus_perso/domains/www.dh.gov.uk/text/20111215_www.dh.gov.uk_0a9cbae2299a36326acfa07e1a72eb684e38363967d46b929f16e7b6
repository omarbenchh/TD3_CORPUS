The weighted capitation formula determines each PCT’s available resources to enable them to commission similar levels of healthcare for populations with similar healthcare need, and to reduce avoidable health inequalities.To provide the NHS with financial stability in a year of transition, the weighted capitation formula has not been applied for 2012-13. All PCTs have received a uniform uplift in their 2012-13 recurrent allocations.Future allocationsSubject to the passing of the Health and Social Care Bill, for 2013-14 onwards, the NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for the allocation of resources to clinical commissioning groups, while the Department of Health will make ring fenced grants to local authorities for their public health responsibilities.See table of actual allocations by PCT and exposition book 2012-13Read Sir David Nicholson’s allocations letterShare this pageShare on FacebookShare on TwitterPublished:14 December 2011From:Department of HealthHelp us improve GOV.UKDon’t include personal or financial information, eg your National Insurance number or credit card details.What you were doingWhat went wrongServices and informationBenefitsBirths, deaths, marriages and careBusiness and self-employedChildcare and parentingCitizenship and living in the UKCrime, justice and the lawDisabled peopleDriving and transportEducation and learningEmploying peopleEnvironment and countrysideHousing and local servicesMoney and taxPassports, travel and living abroadVisas and immigrationWorking, jobs and pensionsDepartments and policyHow government worksDepartmentsWorldwidePoliciesPublicationsAnnouncementsSupport linksHelpCookiesContactRhestr o Wasanaethau CymraegBuilt by the Government Digital ServiceOpen Government LicenceAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated© Crown copyright
