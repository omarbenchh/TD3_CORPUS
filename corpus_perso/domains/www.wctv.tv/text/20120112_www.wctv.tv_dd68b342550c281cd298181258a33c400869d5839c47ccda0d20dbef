These nonprofit organizations contract with the state to handle all prevention, foster care, adoption and Independent Living services to children and families in the child welfare system. The Scorecard will be updated monthly and evaluate the lead agencies on 12 key measures to determine how well they are meeting the most critical needs of these at-risk children.“Florida’s system of community-based care has become a national model over the past decade,” said Department Secretary David Wilkins. “This tool will allow the sharing of best practices and ensure proven successful methods are being used statewide to further improve child safety and well-being.”The scorecard will measure the lead agencies across each indicator, including child safety, family preservation, adoptions, and well-being of children in foster care such as medical and dental services and educational goals.“As providers, the community-based care system is one of the most closely monitored and evaluated systems in the state, perhaps in the country even,"said Mike Cusick, FCC president and CEO. "Our goal in working to develop this scorecard with DCF is to ensure that the measures highlight areas where we are succeeding, while identifying areas of improvement to ensure the system achieves its ultimate goal of keeping kids safe and building strong families."The Scorecard and an explanation of the measurements are available online at http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/cbc/cbcaccountability.shtmlAuthorities: Homeland Security Agent Shoots Would-Be RobberComments are posted from viewers like you and do not always reflect the views of this station.Please enable JavaScript to view the powered by Disqus.powered by DisqusMost ViewedWinn Dixie Manager Accused of Robbing Own StoreLeon County Booking Report: January 18, 2016One person Dead in Madison County ATV AccidentThomasville Road Reopened Following Morning AccidentFlorida Store Clerks Fatally Shoot Armed Robber63-Year-Old Inmate Dies at Florida JailBody Of Man Found Shot On Interstate In Suburban AtlantaBoy Injured in Dog Attack at His North Florida Home2 Dead, Several Injured After Severe weather In FloridaPregnancy & the Zika Virus: What You Need To KnowMost Commentedpowered by DisqusWCTV 1801 Halstead Blvd. Tallahassee, FL 32309Copyright © 2002-2016 - Designed by Gray Digital Media - Powered by Clickability 137110613 - wctv.tv/a?a=137110613Website PolicyTerms of UsePrivacy Policy/YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTSAdvertisingEEO StatementPublic Inspection FileOnline Public Information FileClick Here to access the online Public Inspection FileViewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station's FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.
