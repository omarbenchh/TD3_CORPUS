She says an obesity commissioner should be appointed.New Zealand ranks third highest in the developed world for obesity, according to the OECD, with nearly two-thirds of adults considered overweight or obese, the study said.Labour defends recordThe Labour Party is defending its record on public health following the release of the study's findings.Deputy leader Grant Robertson rejects the suggestion that his party sided with food companies, saying it tried to stop the surge in obesity by banning schools from selling junk food and this was later overturned by the National-led Government.However, Health Minister Tony Ryall says the Government trusts parents and schools to decide what should go in school lunches.Mr Robertson also rejects the study's recommendation that the food industry needs to be governed by an independent regulator."We need to make sure that as much as possible it is done via self-regulation, because that's the way that is most efficient."But clearly, the sector is also one that needs regulation from government - and that needs to be looked at from time to time."The Labour Party will continue to look at policies that are about regulation and get the balance right."Mr Robertson says reducing obesity rates is the responsibility of individuals and the Government.Share on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Google PlusShare on RedditShare on Linked InShare via emailNext story in National: Workers strike as port pushes on with contractor planCopyright © 2012, Radio New ZealandNationalLawyers called in over medical cannabisPassengers jump from burning boatReview: Checkpoint with John CampbellTe Atatu killing: 'We're doing everything we can'Cost of carbon going upLomu gave almost everything awayTop News storiesLawyers called in over medical cannabisPassengers jump from burning boatReview: Checkpoint with John CampbellTe Atatu killing: 'We're doing everything we can'Heavy rain brings drought reliefSubscribeGet the top 8 headlines each day at 8am with our daily email newsletter.National RSSFollow RNZ NewsNationalRegionalPoliticalSportWorldTe Manu KorihiBusinessRuralPacificWeatherContactAbout this SiteWays to ListenAbout RNZHomeNewsNationalConcertPacific© Copyright Radio New Zealand 2016
