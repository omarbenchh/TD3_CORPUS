Some private firms have ignored a call for them to take out PIP implants at no charge.They argue the Government and the medical watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency are at fault for allowing the cut-price implants to be sold in the UK.It’s not their fault that they used them and they say that replacing them with more expensive implants would financially ruin them.Are they right to refuse? Well, morally, no. They carried out the work so they should be responsible if it goes wrong later, surely?Private firms such as Nuffield, Spire Healthcare and BMI have followed the call from Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to replace the implants.But bosses at the firms that have refused would say they were running a business, not a church. They did not manufacture the implants and they did not pass them as safe to use in surgery.So should it be left to the NHS to replace them at a cost of tens of millions of pounds to the taxpayer?Well, as a last resort, it has a duty to.The Welsh government has said it would pay to remove and replace banned breast implants from women who were treated privately.Welsh health minister, Lesley Griffiths, said: “Removing the implants and not replacing them could result in unsightly scarring, loose skin, and potentially the accumulation of fluids, need for drainage, and risk of infection.”The NHS will pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses or no longer exists. Which is not enough.One estimate claims that about 50,000 implants are involved (some cosmetic, some reconstructive), which could cost the NHS as much as £150m.What this whole sorry, scary mess has shown is that there is a shocking lack of governance and regulation on the issue.There needs to be stricter controls over what can be used in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery.There has to be clear and cast-iron responsibility for the work carried out.But also, any woman undertaking a breast implant for whatever reason must be properly informed that they don’t last forever, that they will need replacing and that there is always risk of rupture, however slight.Published by http://www.newsandstar.co.ukSHARE THIS ARTICLEAnne PicklesWill I last long enough to see end of the War?When the going gets tough...Show will to make Cumbria the priority it needs to beNo room for hate in a broken heartMore Anne PicklesMark GreenStack up your troubles(1 comment)Human tide of despairPol-dark nights are here againWe have something to offer all year, not just for the Tour of BritainMore Mark GreenHave your sayCity council buys former Tesco site at Carlisle's Viaduct Estate(56 comments)Boss of north Cumbria's failing hospitals to leave this week(7 comments)Firms charged to use Lake District as backdrop for filming(22 comments)Italian chain planning Carlisle city centre restaurant(7 comments)West Cumbrian police station will not be casualty of cuts, MP told(4 comments)Council tax to rise as Carlisle tries to cope with cuts(38 comments)Petition demands Carlisle council action over dog mess and litter(20 comments)Primark to open store in Carlisle(114 comments)News & Star What's On searchSearch for:Start date:End date:Category:Sort by:VoteHave your shopping habits changed?
