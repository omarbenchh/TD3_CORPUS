The schools are agreeing to step up training for medical students in how to treat PTSD and traumatic brain injury, increase research into the conditions and share new information and best practices.Aides said Mrs. Obama will emphasize that while most troops come home from combat with few or no mental health issues, those who do should not see it as a source of shame or weakness.The Defense Department estimates that nearly 213,000 military personnel have suffered traumatic brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2000.An earlier report by the Rand Corp. think tank estimated that 300,000 veterans of both conflicts suffered post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression. Fewer than half had sought treatment for PTSD over the preceding year and nearly 60 percent of those reporting a probable brain injury weren't evaluated by a physician for one."This is a long-term issue for the nation," said Brad Cooper, the executive director of Joining Forces.There is no new funding associated with the initiative, and medical schools will make their own decisions about how to integrate more training and research into PTSD and traumatic brain injury into their curriculum.The first lady will also headline fundraisers in Richmond and Charlottesville, Va., on Wednesday to raise money for the Democratic National Committee and President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.BW ExtrasPodcastsMandel on EconomicsBehind the CoverCEO Guide to Techmore…RSS FeedsMost PopularTop NewsInnovation Trendsmore…E-mailsAsia InsiderMBA ExpressBW.com Insidermore…BlogsBlogspottingHot PropertyTech Beatmore…Most Popular StoriesReadE-mailedDiscussedThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyLego Is for GirlsGoogle's Spreading Tentacles of InfluenceGatorade Goes Back to the LabImpress Potential Investors in 12 StepsRSS Feed: Most Read StoriesThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyWhich Is America's Best City?Lego Is for GirlsTop B-School Stories of 2011Professional Women and a Secure RetirementRSS Feed: Most E-mailed StoriesFacebook's Holocaust ControversyAmerica's Best, Affordable Places to Raise KidsBullpen DiariesRSS Feed: Most Discussed StoriesMost Popular MultimediaSlide ShowsTuition-Free CollegesTwenty Tips for First-Time ManagersThe Best Design Schools in the WorldRSS Feed: Most Popular Slide ShowsBW Mall - Sponsored LinksBuy a link now!Terms of ServiceTrademarksPrivacy Policy©2016 Bloomberg L.P.
