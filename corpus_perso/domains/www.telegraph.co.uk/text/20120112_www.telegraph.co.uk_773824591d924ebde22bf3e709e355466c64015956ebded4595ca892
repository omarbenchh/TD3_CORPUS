In this case, any treatment should focus on increasing their sense of self-worth."Another person who is very good at online gaming could get rewards from their success; they will be praised by their peers for being the best at it. In this case, they should find other activities which give them the same rewards.Related ArticlesAddicted to the internet?

If a plan to spend a few minutes on the internet regularly turns into hours you may have a problem.Irritability when interrupted: If you regularly get cranky if you are interrupted online it could be a sign you are spending too much time on the internet.Feelings of guilt: If you feel guilty about the amount of time you spend online or if you often find your partner or family nagging you about the time wasted it is possible you have an addiction.Isolation from family and friends: Is your social life suffering because of the amount of time online? Losing touch with friends and family is a sign that you are becoming addicted to the internet.A sense of euphoria when online and panic when offline: If you feel euphoric or only calm when you are online while you feel anxious and cut off when offline there is a chance you could be spending too much time at the computerDry eyes, aches, weight gain or sleep disturbances: Any physical changes as a result of spending too much time online are obvious signs that something is wrong.Tips for breaking an internet addiction:Ask yourself, “What am I missing out on when I spend so much time on the Internet?” Write down these activities and decrease your Internet time to pursue some of them.Set reasonable Internet use goals and stick to them. Take frequent breaks, at least 5 minutes each hour, and do some other activity.Alter your routine to break your usage patterns. If you spend evenings on the Internet, start limiting your use to mornings.Seek out friends and acquaintances who “couldn’t care less” about the Internet. Take time to appreciate the fact that all life is not yet online.Stay connected to the offline world. Visit newsstands, book and music stores, and participate in entertainment such as museums, music, and live theatre. Novels and poetry readings are hard to experience online.Treat the Internet as a tool. Stay focused on the fact that the Internet is a means to an end. Plan your strategy—whether you’re looking for information or entertainment—with the end in mind and you’ll save valuable time.Source: University of California, San FranciscoInternetNews »UK News »Technology »Technology News »The best tabletsIn InternetInstagramming the worldInstagramming the UKMeet Amelia: the computer that's after your jobHow hackers took over my computer'Computers are getting smarter.
