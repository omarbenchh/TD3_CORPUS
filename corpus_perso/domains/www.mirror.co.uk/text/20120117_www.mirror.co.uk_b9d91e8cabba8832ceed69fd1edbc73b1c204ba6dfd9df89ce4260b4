This heralds a new era of hope for women with ovarian cancer who have previously been faced with a devastating diagnosis plus a lack of innovative treatments.”The drug has been licensed for use against bowel, breast, lung and kidney cancer but scientists found it halted ovarian growths.In women with advanced tumours who were given Avastin and chemotherapy, their illness did not deteriorate for 18.2 months compared to 12 months for those who just had chemo. The drug works by stopping the tumours forming blood vessels.Consultant oncologist Dr Timothy Perren, from St James’ Hospital, Leeds, said: “Ovarian cancer has the worst outcomes of all ­gynaecological cancers and halting disease progression for six months is a major step forward in treating it.”But Ovarian Cancer Action boss Gilda Witte said more work needed to be done to diagnose the disease earlier and save more lives.DailyMirror>Recently PublishedGene alert for breast and ovarian cancerWomen with mutations in the BRCA1 gene have a much higher chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer, the study pointed outProtein that halts cancer discovered by British scientistsDavid Walliams says judges were 'worried' when Amanda Holden wasn't wellPrevious ArticlesWhy women must keep their ovariesA reader who was due to have a ­hysterectomy wrote to me recently asking if she should insist on keeping her ovaries.Stephen Lawrence verdict: Killers Gary Dobson and David Norris united in race hateRelated TagsSee AlsoHospitalsOvarian cancerRecommended in Technology & ScienceBenefitsWatch mum-of-12 Cheryl Prudham chase off reporter who knocked on her doorHospitalsFamily heartbroken after tragic baby son found dead in Moses basket following hospital dischargeSpidermanSpider-Man would need SIZE 89 feet to be able to walk up walls, scientists sayCocaineCocaine can cause your brain to EAT itself, shocking new research has revealedHandsThe 12 health secrets you hold in your hands and what they meanRacismMother left outraged after teacher 'called her black son a "monkey" in front of his classmates'Violent disorderViolent gang who terrorised pregnant woman during campaign against innocent neighbourhood cagedMultiple sclerosisMiracle 'cure' for multiple sclerosis as paralysed patients able to walk againSainsbury'sSainsbury's recall BREAD amid fears it has been contaminated with METALZoosWatch two huge gorillas trade blows in furious zoo enclosure punch-upMost Read in NewsProstitutionNursery teacher caught working as £30 prostitute in saucy hidden camera footageMissing personsMissing Noah Chamberlin: Fears grow for boy, 2, who disappeared during woodland walkSmartphonesSnow joke: Winter blast could cripple UK smartphones as freezing temperatures bust batteriesGiant ratsWoman horrified after lifting toilet lid and discovering massive rat splashing aroundHatton Garden robberyHatton Garden heist leader found sick pictures of Tory child abuser in deposit box on earlier jobRecommended on the MirrorBenefitsWatch mum-of-12 Cheryl Prudham chase off reporter who knocked on her doorHospitalsFamily heartbroken after tragic baby son found dead in Moses basket following hospital dischargeSpidermanSpider-Man would need SIZE 89 feet to be able to walk up walls, scientists sayCocaineCocaine can cause your brain to EAT itself, shocking new research has revealedHandsThe 12 health secrets you hold in your hands and what they meanStephanie DavisStephanie Davis and Sam Reece's love story, as she's blasted for cosying up to Jeremy McConnell on CBBRacismMother left outraged after teacher 'called her black son a "monkey" in front of his classmates'Violent disorderViolent gang who terrorised pregnant woman during campaign against innocent neighbourhood cagedMultiple sclerosisMiracle 'cure' for multiple sclerosis as paralysed patients able to walk againLiverpool transfer newsLiverpool youngster Jerome Sinclair closing in on Watford move after rejecting new Anfield dealLike us on FacebookThe MirrorView:DesktopMobileBuySellFind a jobFind a homeFind a new homeFind a local businessFind a garageAbout UsContact UsSell Your StoryHow to ComplainArchiveCorrections & ClarificationsGoogle SurveyPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyTerms and ConditionsPaper Subscription to the Daily MirrorPaper Subscription to the Sunday MirrorIrish MirrorNewsUK NewsPoliticsWorld newsWeird NewsCrimeReal Life StoriesTechnologyPlayBingoCasinoCrosswordsCompetitionsDatingGoal TimePokerUsVsTh3mSportFootballFormula 1BoxingTennisRugby LeagueRugby UnionCricketGolfHorse racingOther SportsFantasy FootballTVTV NewsTV PreviewsTV ReviewsCelebsCelebrity NewsUS gossipFashion & BeautyTV & film newsWeird celeb newsMoneyCity NewsPersonal financeJobsQuids InOpinionNews OpinionSport Opinion3am OpinionLifestyle OpinionLifestyleHealthHoroscopesStaying inGoing outReader OffersSex & RelationshipsDietingCartoonsFamilyGardeningTravelMotoring© Mirror Online Ltd
