for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterAndy Burnham (pic: DM)Sneaky health chiefs have ordered doctors to pick out services for privatisation.The Government has sent a letter to all primary care trusts demanding they identify at least three services that can be handed to the private sector.Labour says the move is further evidence of Tory plans to privatise the NHS by stealth and accused David Cameron of breaking his pledge to keep the NHS in public ownership.The letter from Dame Barbara Hakin, commissioning chief at the Department of Health, says primary care trusts should work with new GP commissioning groups on ways they can extend “choice of provider”.Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham will today lead a Commons debate to try to halt the Tory reforms.Speaking about the letter, which was sent to trusts in July last year, Mr Burnham said: “We have learnt from bitter experience not to trust the Prime Minister’s NHS pledges.“Just two months after promising that there would be no privatisation of the health service, his Government outrageously orders the privatisation of three local services.”A Department of Health source said allowing “new, high quality organisations” to provide services to NHS patients would drive up standards.DailyMirror>Recently PublishedImpact of Tories' botched health reforms revealed as bosses warn staff will be cutNHS bosses
