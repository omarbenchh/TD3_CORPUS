'While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with.'The poll found that women look for a good personality, a sense of humour and good looks, while dodgy dancing, leaving clothes lying around on the bedroom floor and snoring are sure signs of imperfection.One in five women would forgive leaving the toilet seat up and a lack of culinary skills but men using their girlfriend's toothbrush and not listening were sure fire ways to lose 'perfect' points.'The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of David Beckham, but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference,' says Miss McReynolds.CLICK HERE FOR MORE WORLD NEWSsharesMore News:Playboy cover star wins Russian parliament seatGenerosity is key to a happy marriageComments:You might also be interested in…Look What I'm WearingLATEST FASHIONSorbet Surroundings12 August 2015LATEST NAILSClassic Elements12 August 2015LATEST HAIRMCH's WAVY HAIR10 February 2015More: Look What I'm WearingInStyle: Look Of The DayLOOK OF THE DAYOlivia WildeMonday 18th JanuaryLOOK OF THE DAYMaisie WilliamsFriday 15th JanuaryLOOK OF THE DAYEdie CampbellThursday 14th JanuaryMore: Look Of The DaySubscribe and get 12 issues of Marie Claire from only £12.99!Choose how you want to receive Marie Claire  available in print or on your iPadPrint OnlySubscribeiPad OnlySubscribeLatestFashionHair & BeautyFeaturesLatest:Monday 18 JanuaryMaking A Murderer: Whats Next For Steven Avery?Life Coaching Session: How To Make 2016 Your YearThe Duchess Of Cambridge Has Landed An Important New JobThe Best Beauty Blogs EverImmigrants Will Have To Earn £35,000 To Settle In The UK From April This YearDrinking Your Own Urine - Can It Really be Good For You?1920s Hairstyles: How To Do It & Who To Copy#BREAKFREE Week Three: AgeismThe Powerful Movie That Could Beat The Revenant At The OscarsWhy Carrie And Big Should Never Have Got Together According To Sex And The City's CreatorMore FashionThe Critics' Choice Awards 2016: See All The Red Carpet PicsKids' Clothes 2016: The Marie Claire EditGolden Globes 2016: The After Party Pics You Haven't Seen YetGolden Globes 2016: See All The Red Carpet PicsBest Running Shoes: 10 Styles Guaranteed To Get You MovingBest Camel Coats: The Marie Claire Edit45 Christmas Gifts For Cool KidsChristmas Jumpers: The Chicest Festive Knits For Right NowJumper Dresses: Shop Your New Wardrobe HeroNew Year's 2015: Show-Stopping Buys To Celebrate In StyleMore Hair & Beauty1920s Hairstyles: How To Do It & Who To CopyFringes: The Hottest Hairstyle Everyone Can Totally OwnBrunette Hairstyles: Inspiration From The A-ListWavy And Tousled Hairstyles: 41 Effortless Spring Looks#HeSmellsGood: Colin Farrell Talks 'Taches, Waxing & Homemade Irish StewBlonde Hairstyles: Your Guide To Getting It Just Right...Medium Hairstyles: This Season's Hottest LookSo, What Exactly Is Bronde Hair?The Return Of The Curtain: Could The Worst 90s Hairstyle Of All Be Making A Comeback?Wedding HairstylesMore FeaturesLife Coaching Session: How To Make 2016 Your YearDrinking Your Own Urine - Can It Really be Good For You?Why Carrie And Big Should Never Have Got Together According To Sex And The City's CreatorGIRLS Is Back And Look Who's Getting MarriedAnne Hathaway Has Written An Open Letter To The Internet Defending Her Friend Jennifer LawrenceAll Hail Netflix: Gilmore Girls Is Coming Back For Another Series...And Today In Celebrity Social MediaThe 'Friends' Reunion: Ross (AKA David Schwimmer) Has Spoken OutCelebrity Babies 2016"I Loved Her From The Day I Saw Her" - Most Romantic Celebrity QuotesGet Our FREE Daily NewsletterYour emailPlus get great deals and exclusive offers from Time Inc.
