(CBC)About 60 of the 360 delegates to the Canadian University Press' annual NASH conference for student journalists, held at the Harbour Towers Hotel and Suites, came down with flu-like symptoms Saturday night.Five staffers from the University of New Brunswick's Brunswickan flew home on Sunday, as scheduled, including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Christopher Cameron.But two who fell ill stayed behind, along with two others, who are now showing symptoms of the highly contagious gastrointestinal illness, which include vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, headaches and muscle aches."A lot of the students did end up going to the hospital, any that were having any serious, I guess, effects [of] the virus," said Cameron."And they did have paramedics on scene, right outside the hotel, they had two or three ambulances for students that really needed to get to the hospital."The school newspaper will have to pick up the extra cost of rebooking flights for the sick students, Cameron said.Students get outbreak updates through TwitterAmy Badry, one of 12 University of Calgary students attending the conference, said that during the quarantine, information was poorly communicated.Badry said delegates were left to do their own research and call hospitals, all the while looking to Twitter for updates on the situation."The co-ordinators were unprepared for this, so it's something to think about when an event like this happens," Badry said. "What is the best way to disseminate information to the people affected by it? And the best way is not through Twitter."Badry said she didn't fall ill but four other Calgary students did when the outbreak hit during the conference gala."We were all dressed up and running outside and people were just vomiting everywhere," she said.Six out of 10 students from the Aquinian at St. Thomas University in Fredericton also got sick."While we haven't had it confirmed, we're pretty sure its Norwalk virus given how it presented and developed," said Suzanne Germain of the Vancouver Island Health Authority."We suspect a student, or a few students, contracted this somehow — it takes one to two days to incubate — then they travelled to the meeting, and then it spread quite rapidly among the student group."Noroviruses are found in the stool or vomit of infected people.People can become infected through direct contact with an infected person, by touching contaminated surfaces or objects, or by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated.Symptoms usually last only 48 to 72 hours.The 74th NASH conference began Wednesday and ended Sunday in Victoria. It was hosted by the Martlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria, and the Nexus, the paper for students at Camosun College.Report TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterLatest New Brunswick News HeadlinesVitalité reps discuss hospital bed cuts with Restigouche mayors readcommentsOttawa may ante up more cash for new infrastructure projectsBurkina Faso attacks won't deter Moncton restaurateurreadcommentsIce level warning issued after snowmobiler crashes through Nashwaak RiverreadcommentsJustin Trudeau's Liberal cabinet meets in St. AndrewsMust WatchVideoRAW: Saint John storm reaction1:05Three Saint John residents discuss how they've been getting around the city after Wednesday's stormVideoFinding Marissa Shephard1:45A Moncton woman who is wanted on a Canada-wide warrant in connection with the murder of Baylee Wylie "could be anywhere," say RCMPVideoRAW: Soldiers return to Gagetown1:03Watch Canadian soldiers and their families reflect on their mission to Lebanon and Jordan to help Syrian refugeesVideoReaction to Covered Chips boycott demand0:40Fredericton residents react to the union's call for people to boycott Covered Bridge Potato Chips while workers are on strikeTop News HeadlinesNewLeaf discount airline postpones service, will refund ticketsEagles guitarist Glenn Frey dead at 67readcommentsEarth's oceans absorbed colossal amount of heat in past 18 yearsreadcommentsKevin O'Leary and Peter MacKay top Tory leadership pollreadcommentsCBC Forum: After Cologne attacks, what's the future of integration in Europe?Most ViewedOne man dead after snowmobile crash in northern N.B.Martello Tower and Fundy National Park to get $21M upgradeBeyond orientation: Onboarding is the new normalTuberculosis case at UNB sparks efforts to prevent outbreakNew Brunswick farm bringing quail eggs to regionDr. Eilish Cleary, province reach settlementWinter storm will impact southern N.B., miss northern part of provinceSaint John Energy is now renting heat pumps to customersCindi Hachey loses 240 pounds running at Regent MallTuberculosis case confirmed at UNB FrederictonMermaid company aims to empower kids with 'edu-tainment' eventsMore complaints against driver of motorized wheelchair surfaceDon't Miss'Excessive fatigue' at CP an 'immediate threat' to rail safety: Transport CanadaGo PublicApple demands widow get court order to access dead husband's passwordNew budget airlines to keep WestJet, Air Canada on their toesBosmaTim Bosma slaying: jury selection in Millard, Smich trial starts MondayNetflixNetflix bound by copyright rules, contracts with studiosFINANCIAL PLANNINGDivorce: splitting your assets means rethinking retirement planRenewable energySolar energy set to shine in greener AlbertaUnreservedCree mythology written in the starsShould we put animals on trial?fifth estateMan charged with murdering 3 women blames police harassmentMarketplaceToxic jewelry: Cadmium found in Ardene, Aldo productsRené Angélil: Not just a manager of Céline DionRRSPGet your debt under control before building a nest eggAnalysisSean Cooper pays off mortgage in 3 years and earns online hateEconomyMarket turmoil: Why instability shouldn't spark widespread panic among Canadian investorsExplore CBCCBC HomeTVRadioNewsSportsMusicArtsKidsLocalDocumentariesComedyBooksParentsAboriginalWeatherCBC ConnectsDigital ArchivesGamesContestsSite MapStay ConnectedMobileRSSPodcastsNewsletters & AlertsServices and InformationCorporate InfoPublic AppearancesCommercial ServicesReuse & PermissionTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCBC ShopHelpContact UsJobsDoing Business with UsRenting FacilitiesCBCRadio-Canada©2016 CBC/Radio-Canada.
