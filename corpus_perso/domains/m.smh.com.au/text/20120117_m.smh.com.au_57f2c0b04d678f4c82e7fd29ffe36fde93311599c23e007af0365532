It had said: "Failure to do so may result in severe injury to the patient or death."He said that the person inserting the catheter "well overshot the runway".Mr Mitchell said he thought that doctors were bound to have read it because it was "such a significant event" inserting anything into the heart or close to the heart.Mr Mitchell said that, according to his understand of the evidence, placing catheters into the heart was a dangerous procedure "if not lethal, if wrongly placed".Dr McLean agreed.Dr McLean said that some migration of the tip of the catheter was allowed for because of movement of the arm into which it had been placed and that it was not necessarily dangerous.However, he said that, if the catheter tip migrated to where it was pressing against the wall of the heart, it could produce inflammation.There could also be injury from the concentrated fluid being released by the catheter.Dr McLean said that the doctor inserting the catheter on June 23, 2008, had initially put it lower in the heart but had withdrawn it five centimetres because of ectopic beats in the right ventricle.Mr Williams, cross-examining, said that a withdrawal of five centimetres from where the tip of the catheter was initially placed seemed a huge margin of error.Dr McLean said that the deeper the catheter went into the heart, the greater the risk, and the Federal Drugs Administration had said that catheter tips should not be allowed to migrate within the heart itself.The inquiry continues.Follow Us on FacebookThe Sydney Morning Herald - smh.com.auMost Viewed1 Homeless man had $70 in his wallet but $30,000 in the bank when his body was found2 Pandamonium as panda optical illusion runs wild on the internet3 Father abandons baby at railway station to bash friend, video shows4 Shooters MP Robert Borsak lashed by Attorney-General Gabrielle Upton over perjury claims5 Manly Sea Eagles clash with Warringah Council over Brookvale Oval rentHomeNSW NewsNSW NewsSydney TrafficNSW State Election 2015QuizzesTopSectionsSydney Morning Herald - smh.com.auNSWWorldBusinessPoliticsNationalSportCommentTechnologyDigital LifeIT ProEnvironmentEntertainmentLife & StyleTravellerCarsExec StylePropertyWeatherPhotosVideosMore sitesMore sitesSMHThe AgeBrisbane TimesWA TodayCanberra TimesBusiness DayDriveDomainWeatherGood FoodDaily LifeRSVPEssential BabyEssential KidsThe VineJobsCopyright © 2016 Fairfax DigitalTerms of use »Standard site »Feedback »
