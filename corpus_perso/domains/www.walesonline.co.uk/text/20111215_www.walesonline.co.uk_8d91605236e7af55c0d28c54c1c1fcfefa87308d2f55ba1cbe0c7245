Good food hygiene means a good rating, which is good for business.“Professor Hugh Pennington, who chaired the public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli outbreak supports such a scheme as an inexpensive way of driving significant improvements in food safety.”Food business, including restaurants, takeaways, school and hospital canteens, are awarded a food hygiene rating of between zero and five based on their regular environmental health inspections.A rating of zero means urgent improvement is necessary; a five means a business has very good hygiene standards.The ratings were launched in October 2010 and are available online. Some businesses, usually those with a rating of three (generally satisfactory) or more, chose to display their ratings on their premises.Under the proposals, businesses which do not display their hygiene rating could be hit with a £200 fixed penalty notice fine and a maximum fine of £1,000 if prosecuted.The consultation document, which is published today, says the mandatory scheme would apply to all places where people eat out and where they buy their food from, including supermarkets, delicatessens and bakeries.It is thought 30,000 businesses in Wales would be covered by the scheme. Currently more than 13,500 have been rated under the voluntary scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency.Julie Barratt, director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health in Wales, said: “We think this is a marvellous idea and believe it is important for the public to be able to make informed choices about where they eat.“The publication of a hygiene score on the door means people can make appropriate choices and it will also drive up standards – if a one-rated business is next door to a five-rated business, the public will chose the five, meaning the other will have to up its game.”Maria Battle, senior director of Consumer Focus Wales, which has campaigned for a mandatory scheme, said: “The overwhelming majority of people in Wales have told us they want a simple and transparent food hygiene standards system with mandatory display of food hygiene ratings.“They also said they want to be able to download inspection reports from the food hygiene rating scheme website, while more than half of people told us they want to simply pick up the phone or write to their local council to obtain the information.“We’re pleased a question on the public availability of inspection reports has been asked as part of the consultation.“We also welcome on-the-spot penalties to deal with any food businesses that are unhappy about displaying poor ratings on their premises. Similar schemes that ran in New York and Toronto have been successful and helped to deter businesses from non-display in the first place and drove up standards.”Health Minister Lesley Griffiths explains why the Welsh Government wants to become the first in the UK to force food businesses to display their hygiene scores on their doorsWalesOnline>Recently PublishedFood hygiene ratings planCUSTOMERS are set to be told how hygienic restaurants, takeaways and supermarkets are in a new ratings scheme.Minister proposes hygiene ratings go on display across Wales on visit to Llandudno caféSoaring numbers of Welsh find new lives in Australia as UK gloom growsPrevious ArticlesDrivers face more A55 miseryMOTORISTS face morning rush-hour misery all this week due to A55 roadworks.Business must reach for the skies, like Welsh adventurerRichard ParksSpecial report: Daily Post Achievement Wales 2011Related TagsOrganisationsWelsh GovernmentPlacesLlandudnoConwyPeopleLesley GriffithsRecommended in Wales NewsStereophonicsStereophonics team up with Brains Brewery to launch their own beerHuw LewisTeachers hail 'passionate' Education Minister after shock resignationCarmarthen Town FCForget Manchester United and Barcelona, Carmarthen Town have surely got the coolest club shop in the worldRhondda Cynon TafRodney - the dog with no back paws - is ready to have his trotters after £10,000 was donated by generous supportersMerthyr TydfilMerthyr Tydfil school recently visited by Prince Charles praised by education watchdog EstynBridgendFears raised over road safety as police investigate collision which injured two boysFirst World WarChildren to learn about Welsh soldiers in Battle of the SommeMost Read in NewsCardiffPolice called after body found close to Cardiff parkCardiffPolice investigation launched after man, 45, found dead in Cardiff gardenWales weatherMet Office issues weather warning for ice across WalesLlanfairpwllHotpoint refused to deliver to a Welsh address unless it was provided in EnglishPenarthThe house that's been 'rotting' for nearly 20 years in the middle of a street full of £250,000 homesRecommended on WalesOnlineSwansea City FCSwansea City team news: Jack Cork replaces Modou Barrow in only change as Swans host WatfordStereophonicsStereophonics team up with Brains Brewery to launch their own beerHuw LewisTeachers hail 'passionate' Education Minister after shock resignationCarmarthen Town FCForget Manchester United and Barcelona, Carmarthen Town have surely got the coolest club shop in the worldEssential Wales10 brilliantly kitsch vintage shops in WalesWales OnlineFollow UsContact UsSend A StoryAdvertiseThe EditorJournalistsJoin us on social media.For the latest local news straight to your Twitter, Facebook feed, e-mail inbox or tablet.Twitter@walesonline@walesrugby@welsh_football@yourcardiffE-EditionsDownload our e-editions here.FacebookWalesOnlineWelsh Rugby NewsCardiff CitySwansea CityNewsletterSign up to our daily newsletter.Contact usGot a story in your area?Is there something happening in your area you would like us to report on?Emailnewsdesk@walesonline.co.ukPhoneNewsdesk: 029 2024 3630Advertising enquiries: 029 2022 3333Postal AddressWalesOnline, Media Wales, Six Park Street, Cardiff, CF10 1XRContactsNewsdesk029 2024 3630newsdesk@walesonline.co.ukWalesOnline: Paul Rowland029 2024 3626paul.rowland@walesonline.co.ukPicturedesk: Rob Norman029 2024 3649rob.norman@walesonline.co.ukPhotosales: Saffron Herbert029 2024 4330saffron.herbert@walesonline.co.ukCompetitions and promotions: Sally Krouma029 2024 4314sally.krouma@walesonline.co.ukWork experience queriesciaran.jones@walesonline.co.ukOrganised a special event?Tell us about it and, if possible, send us a pictureContactDavid PrincePhone029 2024 3620Emailcommunities@walesonline.co.ukSend a storyEmailnewsdesk@walesonline.co.ukPhone029 2024 3630Postal AddressNewsdesk, Media Wales, Six Park Street, Cardiff CF10 1XRAdvertise with WalesOnlineWe reach over 1,384,563* unique users a month with dedicated coverage of all things Welsh.To book an advert with WalesOnline call 029 2024 4296 or 029 2022 2444, email iestyn.page@trinitymirror.com or visit Media Wales website for more informationWalesOnline is part of Media Wales, publisher of the Western Mail, South Wales Echo, Wales on Sunday and the seven Celtic weekly titles, offering you unique access to our audience across Wales online and in print.For all general advertising enquiries please ring 029 2022 2444, or for recruitment advertising, please ring 029 2000 7207.The EditorCeri GouldEditor, WalesOnlineEmailceri.gould@walesonline.co.ukCeri has been editor of WalesOnline since April 2012.
