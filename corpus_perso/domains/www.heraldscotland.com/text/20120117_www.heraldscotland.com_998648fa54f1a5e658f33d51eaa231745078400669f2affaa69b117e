The other half received placebo chocolate bars.Women receiving the extra flavonoids reduced their risk of suffering a heart attack in the next decade by 3.4%. Their insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were also significantly reduced by the flavonoids.Professor Aedin Cassidy of Norwich Medical School at UEA said: "These results are significant from a public health perspective because they provide further concrete evidence that diet has a beneficial clinical effect over and above conventional drug treatment."However, Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, which funded the study, emphasised the results do not mean women with type 2 diabetes should eat more chocolate.He stressed that commercially available chocolate does not contain nearly as much flavonoid as the women in this trial consumed, and eating too much can lead to weigh gain.Share articlePrevious studies have shown dietary flavonoids reduce the risk factors for heart disease in healthy people. However, this is the first long-term study to examine their effect on a medicated, high-risk group.Dr Frame said: "It will be interesting to see whether larger studies of different flavonoids in more diverse populations over longer periods demonstrate similar effects."Promoted StoriesComments & ModerationWe moderate all comments on Herald Scotland on either a pre-moderated or post-moderated basis.
