The meals had anywhere from less than half a cup to more than a cup and a half of macaroni and cheese, the main dish.That was presented along with plenty of green beans and unsweetened applesauce, plus a whole grain roll and milk.Jennifer Savage of The Pennsylvania State University in University Park and her colleagues found that the bigger the entrée size, the more mac and cheese -- and the less of the healthy side dishes -- kids ate.Preschoolers finished almost all of their smallest portion of mac and cheese, for an average of about 145 calories. But they still ate the majority of much bigger portions, and put away 390 calories worth of the main course when they started with the most on their plate.When they were served the smallest entrée, kids ate almost half of their healthy side dishes, including fruits and veggies, compared to only a quarter when they were served the biggest mac and cheese portion, Savage's team reports in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Kids' total lunchtime calorie counts varied based on entrée size as well: they ate an average of 506 calories with the biggest portion, and 315 with the smallest.Ad FeedbackSweitzer said that packing too much of the main course for lunch is a problem she sees all the time with parents, in part because they're concerned they won't include enough food and their kids will be hungry."You will see parents pack the whole easy mac and cheese portion," she said. "That would be a huge amount -- it would be adequate for an adult to eat as part of lunch, and they'll pack that whole thing for the child to eat."And a four-year-old, she said, won't make balanced food choices on their own in that situation."If you give the child an option for a large portion of an entrée food that they really like, they will eat that more and they'll fill up. They'll reach their satiety point and they'll just stop eating," Sweitzer told Reuters Health.She added that another strategy to encourage kids to eat their fruits and veggies is for parents and older siblings to set a good example by choosing those as healthy snacks and making sure they're loading up on their nutrient-packed side dishes at meals.- Reuters| Saved Stories | Saved Stories| Saved Stories | Saved StoriesLife & Style HomepageSponsored linksRecipe searchLife & Style HeadlinesPrince Harry and Greek Princess Maria-Olympia romance denied by royal sourceTeen feminist mocked for her body hair says the hate was 'worth it'British teen Dion Parratt claims energy drink addiction put her in hospitalCritics' Choice Awards 2016 red carpet: lots of sparkle, little colourHow to pronounce foreign foods: quinoa, acai, bouillabaisseChore Challenge: Try swapping the household chores for a fortnightThousands of older people exploring 'rational suicide': NitschkeMichelle Bridges blasted as 'irresponsible' for posting post-natal workout tipsHow - and when - to pick perfect fruitHow do I prevent my dog from peeing on someone?We love these straightforward tampon tinsAt what age should children be allowed to swear and get away with it?Tips for Wellington Cup day punters and Fashion in the Field competitorsAuckland mum starts petition for more shade at playgroundsAd FeedbackStuff HeadlinesDumped bride sells everything to travel the world aloneRoseneath view-blocking fence not a kid's play fort, psychologist tells courtEagles frontman Glenn Frey is dead at 67 - reportsPolice seek man sighted outside home of murdered Te Atatu womanTVNZ's Renee Wright backs Jenny-May Clarkson as 'eyesore' scandal continuesPrince Harry and Greek Princess Maria-Olympia romance denied by royal sourceHow to pronounce foreign foods: quinoa, acai, bouillabaisseThe lost chord: Jazzman finds $300,000 piano in Wairoa cupboardJason Gunn thanks public for support after bin accidentThe extreme ends of drug and alcohol useAir NZ flight from Tokyo to Auckland hit severe turbulence during dinner serviceEngineers come up with model to prevent airport congestionWhat happened when a Chinese TV station replaced its meteorologist with a chatbotAirbnb properties that are hardest to get intoSkiing behind a speeding train - it doesn't end wellSpecial offersMost popularViewedSharedCommentedMillion-dollar homes on the rise at Lake TekapoView-blocking fence called overbearing and aggressiveBail no barrier to Head Hunter's play timeHealth and safety legislation sees Peter Jackson resign as Weta Workshop directorHow to pronounce foreign foods: quinoa, acai, bouillabaisseMax Key splits with girlfriend Amelia FinlaysonBrisbane's 'free the nipple' picnic a quiet affairPrince Harry and Greek Princess Maria-Olympia romance denied by royal sourceDon't belly-shame Jenny-May Coffin, pregnancy is beautifulWe love these straightforward tampon tinsRecipe: Chimichurri chicken with corn, tomato, cucumber and coriander salsaHow to pronounce foreign foods: quinoa, acai, bouillabaisseWhat's hot in kitchen appliances?Million-dollar homes on the rise at Lake TekapoRecipe: Roasted peaches and cream popsiclesHow your meal affects your moodWe love these straightforward tampon tinsWhittaker's hatches a new product for EasterTips for Wellington Cup day punters and Fashion in the Field competitorsNew Zealand's cheapest and dearest homesOpinion pollHow does a strong cup of coffee make you feel?More alert and awakeJittery, anxiousIt gives me an upset tummyI feel no effectVoteResultFeatured PromotionsSponsored ContentBlogs»Moata's Blog IdleHell is other parentsFour Legs Good: A blog about petsPals and playmates (pictures)Jon Bridges builds a houseNew Zealand's best deck built yesterdayDaily FixHoroscopesWhat do the stars have in store for you today?SudokuRev up your mind with our numbers gameCrosswordTest your knowledge with our daily crosswordLove & SexLifeFood & WineWell & GoodBeautyFashionHome & PropertyWeddingsCuteStuffPuzzlesStuff.co.nzAbout Us|Contact Us|Terms and conditions|Privacy Policy|View Smartphone SiteSubscribeText|Follow us on Facebook and Twitter|Newspapers|Magazine subscriptions|RSS - Top StoriesServicesFairfax Archives|Newspapers in Education|A-Z Directories|Online Advertising|Print Advertising|CareersClassifiedsDeath Notices|Celebrations|Trade Me|Jobs|Property|Motors|Accommodation|Personals|Newspaper ClassifiedsNewspapersDominion Post|The Press|Waikato Times|Auckland Now|Taranaki Daily News|Manawatu Standard|Marlborough Express|Nelson Mail|Timaru Herald|Southland TimesOther SitesEssential Mums|Cuisine|NZ House & Garden|NZ Fishing News|NZ Life & Leisure|NZ GardenerBreaking news?Send us your photos, videos and tip-offs:Emailnewstips@stuff.co.nzPhone0800 697 8833&copy 2014 Fairfax New Zealand Limited
