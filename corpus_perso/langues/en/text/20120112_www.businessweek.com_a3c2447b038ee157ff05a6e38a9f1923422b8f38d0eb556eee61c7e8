The company previously closed the Lincoln, Neb., facility where the products were manufactured and says it does not know when operations will resume. Novartis expects to take a $120 million charge for the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the recalls.Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez cut his 2012 sales forecast and full-year earnings estimate for the company by $560 million and 20 cents per share, respectively. According to an investment note from Fernandez, the figure reflects the loss of a year's worth of sales of the recalled products, roughly $390 million, plus $170 million in lost production from an expected three-month shutdown of the facility.The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating manufacturing and quality-control problems at the plant and is expected to be involved in approving the restart of operations."History suggests that few manufacturing challenges resolve quickly, but a partial resumption of manufacturing is certainly possible, although a resumption of manufacturing and a full recovery in the recalled brands are likely to take considerably longer to resolve, particularly given the FDA's involvement," Fernandez states.In a worst-case scenario, Fernandez expects Novartis would lose $750 million in income if all products manufactured at the Lincoln plant are suspended for one year. That would be a 30 to 35 cent cut in earnings per share.Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Novartis to earn $5.55 per share this year.In afternoon trading, U.S.-listed shares of Novartis fell 5 cents to $56.95.BW ExtrasPodcastsMandel on EconomicsBehind the CoverCEO Guide to Techmore…RSS FeedsMost PopularTop NewsInnovation Trendsmore…E-mailsAsia InsiderMBA ExpressBW.com Insidermore…BlogsBlogspottingHot PropertyTech Beatmore…Most Popular StoriesReadE-mailedDiscussedThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyLego Is for GirlsGoogle's Spreading Tentacles of InfluenceGatorade Goes Back to the LabImpress Potential Investors in 12 StepsRSS Feed: Most Read StoriesThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyWhich Is America's Best City?Lego Is for GirlsTop B-School Stories of 2011Professional Women and a Secure RetirementRSS Feed: Most E-mailed StoriesFacebook's Holocaust ControversyAmerica's Best, Affordable Places to Raise KidsBullpen DiariesRSS Feed: Most Discussed StoriesMost Popular MultimediaSlide ShowsTuition-Free CollegesTwenty Tips for First-Time ManagersThe Best Design Schools in the WorldRSS Feed: Most Popular Slide ShowsBW Mall - Sponsored LinksBuy a link now!Terms of ServiceTrademarksPrivacy Policy©2016 Bloomberg L.P.
