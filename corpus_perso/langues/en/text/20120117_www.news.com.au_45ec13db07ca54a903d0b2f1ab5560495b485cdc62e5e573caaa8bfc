Picture: AP Source: APHE has never had sex, yet fathers 14 children.Trent Arsenault hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the US Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.Now, the Fremont, California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene pool to father children, has revealed that he is a 36-year-old virgin.The revelation on CNN host Anderson Cooper's daytime show, Anderson, means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: "I coined this term 'donor sexual' and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that."An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: "So you do not have sex?""I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin," the donor explained. "Except I'll have 15 plus kids" - a statement that drew applause from the audience, to the confusion of the host.The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage.A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a "a thrill". The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.Read more about the 36-year-old virgin dad at the Daily Mail.Increase Text SizeDecrease Text SizePrintEmailShareAdd to DiggAdd to del.icio.usAdd to FacebookAdd to KwoffAdd to MyspaceAdd to NewsvineWhat are these?Back to top of pageFASHION PHOTOSCritics’ Choice Awards 2016 Red CarpetHOLLYWOOD stars are vying for glory as the glittering 21st Annual Critics’ Choice Awards ceremony gets underway.50Golden Globes 2016: Best of social mediaCHECK out all the best snaps taken by your favourite stars from the red carpet to the after parties at the 2016 Golden Globes.15Best wedding photos of 2015THIS year’s Junebug Weddings competion had over 10,000 entries from 45 countries.
