Dozens of women march on Harley Street clinics demanding 'dangerous'...Count the kicks: Meet the 12 mums who have bared their bumps after the death of a baby to raise awareness of...Share this articleShareHis comments have caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits.They came as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide-ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles.AGONY OF MUM-TO-BEWhen Anntina Maughan had her breasts enlarged, she was thrilled with the results.Now, four years later and pregnant, the mother of two couldn't be more unhappy with them.Scans show that one – or both – of the PIP implants have ruptured.But, at five-and-a-half-months pregnant, Miss Maughan, 39, of Crawley in West Sussex, has been advised against surgery to have them out.Miss Maughan paid Harley Medical Group £5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self-esteem due to her small bust.Last year she started experiencing burning pains, and then found lumps in her breasts, raising fears of cancer.She now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant.Miss Maughan believes the Harley Medical Group should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby.She added: 'It is their fault this happened. I went there in full confidence. If it was up to me, I'd have the implants out right now. I worry because I don't know what was in them.'Mr Lansley also pointed the finger at Germany, by naming it as the country that approved the French-made PIPs for use in Europe.Industry experts say that the combination of cut-price implants and low payments to surgeons would have allowed clinics using PIPs to make an extra profit of up to £1,000 per patient.Tests have confirmed that PIP implants, which are extra-fragile and filled with industrial-grade silicone believed to have been made for mattresses, do not cause cancer.However, the Department of Health admits they should never have been put in the human body and the Health Secretary has cleared the way for all women who want them removed to have it done.Last Friday, Mr Lansley said private clinics have a ‘moral duty’ to take them out and if they don’t, the NHS will step in.However, the pledge doesn’t include the replacement of implants.Many private chains have agreed to help their patients free of charge but two of the largest groups have ignored Mr Lansley’s call.Transform, Britain’s biggest cosmetic surgery group, is ‘reviewing its options’. But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to replace PIP implants.The Harley Medical Group has so far removed and replaced ruptured implants for free – but only if they were fitted in the past two years.Mr Braham, who previously ran a travel agency in Australasia, said his business couldn’t cope with the panic from its patients. He said: ‘We don’t have the number of surgeons, the hospitals and the anaesthetists and we don’t have the financial capacity to do it for nothing.‘We do roughly 5,000 to 6,000 operations a year and are not capable of adding another 13,900 on top of that.’ Instead, he wants the NHS to take the implants out – and put new ones in when the woman is on the operating table.Mr Braham wants the Health Service to pay for the bulk of the costs. The firm would pay for new implants – but would need a loan from the Government. The Government however said it would be ‘irresponsible’ of the Harley Medical Group not to help its patients.Fazel Fatah, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We find it outrageous…when women’s peace of mind is at stake, some clinics are refusing to honour their ostensible commitment to duty of care, particularly when they made a profit by using cheaper products and resources.’Dutch authorities have reversed their earlier advice on PIPs and said women who had the implants should have them removed.Share or comment on this articleMOST WATCHED NEWS VIDEOSPrevious1234NextShocking moment angry wife throws husband's mistress in...Garage staff appear to aim for potholes during test driveSwedish woman films as 'migrants' demand sex on the streetsAmazing moment scaffolder appears to walk on water over poolWashing machine bounces around wildly on trampolineLost cat breaks into pet store and goes on catnip benderSchool girl is severely bullied by several girls in ChinaGorillas fight in zoo while onlookers scream for zookeeperGirl's best friend!
