For example, 51% of respondents said community nurse workloads in their area were significantly higher as a result.Did you hear our survey findings on social care cuts discussed on Radio 4 Woman’s Hour? Listen again hereA quarter of nurses said they were rarely confident that patients received the right quantity and quality of community health and social care provision once they were discharged from hospital.Respondents blamed this lack of confidence on understaffing in community services and poor communication between different parts of the health and social care system.The survey was carried out to coincide with the launch of a petition by Age UK as part of its Care in Crisis campaign, demanding urgent reform of the care system for older and disabled people.Nurses in the survey backed the campaign’s aims, with virtually all respondents saying reform was needed to either the social care funding system or the legal and assessment frameworks used for older peoples care and support.Age UK Charity Director Michelle Mitchell said: “These findings provide an interesting snapshot into how the crisis in social care is experienced by those working at the frontline of care: nurses in both hospitals and in the community.“These nurses report seeing social care services for older people reduced and as a result older people having to routinely stay in hospital longer than medically necessary because the support is not there for them to go home. This not only is distressing for older people but also makes no sense financially as the cost of a hospital bed is likely to be much higher than that of providing social care support.”She added: “We urge the government to show vision by creating a system of social care that is fair and sustainable – the social care system is on the verge of collapse and needs urgent reform.”Queen’s Nursing Institute director Rosemary Cook said the causes of delayed discharge had to be “tackled as a matter of urgency”.She said: “We know that people would rather be in their own homes, and are usually healthier and happier there. We also need to reduce the strain on our hospitals, so that as much time and care as possible is freed up for those patients who do need to be there.”“The problem is that the readiness of the community to receive people back for care has been going down, while the demand has been going up,” she added. “Unless we reverse the trend towards dilute skill mix and over-stretched community nursing teams, we will not be able to accelerate discharge, never mind facilitate the shift of care out of hospitals altogether.”However, Ms Cook noted there were some good initiatives around the country. For example, in Stockport assistant practitioners were working across health and social care, and in other places she said community nursing teams were now co-located with social care teams to provide a more “seamless and patient-ready” service for discharged patients.The government is due to publish a white paper on the future of long term care in the spring.View all 3 comments3 CommentsRelated linksNursing Times is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.Care in CrisisYou might also like...Exclusive: Nurse study pinpoints discharge delay failings24 November, 2015Jo StephensonThe key failings that cause delayed discharge and, therefore, contribute to increasing pressures on NHS hospitals have been identified by nursing researchers.Draft guidance on social care for patients after discharge24 June, 2015Hospital and community nurses will be expected to work more closely together to avoid vulnerable patients falling between gaps in care services, under draft guidance issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.Top district nurse to lead ‘nationally important’ discharge planning work5 March, 2015The Queen’s Nursing Institute has appointed a leading community nurse to lead two government-funded research projects, one of which will focus on how to improve discharge planning.Nurses raise concerns about high levels of delayed discharge24 February, 2015Nicola MerrifieldAlmost 70% of nurses across England admit they frequently delay discharge for older patients because there is no support in place for them after hospital, a survey has suggested.Nurses asked for ideas to improve quality and safety in care homes30 January, 2012Steve FordNurses are being asked for ideas on how to improve patient care and working conditions in care homes, as part of a new programme of work by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement.Drug rounds must be protected in care homes to cut high error rates24 January 2012Steve FordNurses and care assistants working in care homes must be protected from interruption during drug rounds to reduce the “serious safety issue” posed by high error rates, according to the authors of a UK study.NHS and councils to share older care role in Scotland16 December, 2011The Press AssociationThe NHS and local authorities in Scotland will share responsibility for elderly care to end the practice of budgets being shunted between departments, it has been confirmed.Nurses could help prevent £600m readmissions fines21 June 2011Charlotte SantryNurses could help trusts to avoid £600m worth of penalties for emergency readmissions, according to a report seen by Nursing Times.Older patients face month long waits for hospital transfer14 May 2013The Press AssociationOlder patients are having to wait for a month before they are transferred from hospitals to care homes, a charity has warned.2013: The nursing year in headlines18 December 2013Nursing has rarely been out of the headlines over the last 12 months.
