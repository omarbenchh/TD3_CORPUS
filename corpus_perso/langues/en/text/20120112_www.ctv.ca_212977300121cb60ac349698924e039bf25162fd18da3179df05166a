(AP / Michael Sohn)BANG Showbiz Published Wednesday, January 11, 2012 8:03AM ESTRobin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from Switzerland to help him fight liver cancer.The Bee Gees star has undergone seven rounds of chemotherapy in his bid to beat the disease and he is now receiving 24-hour care from naturopath nutritionists - which are thought to be the idea of his wife Dwina - at his home in Thame, Oxfordshire.As well as the naturopathic approach - which relies on the body's ability to heal itself through good nutrition, rather than relying on surgery and drugs - Dwina has encouraged the singer to have 20-minute detox sessions.A close family friend told the British The Sun newspaper: "Robin is fighting this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything possible to beat this disease."In November 2011, Robin - who is a teetotal vegan - revealed details on his battle with liver cancer, which was diagnosed in April.At the time, he said: "I have been very unwell and am now on the road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me. I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all."The diagnosis came as a massive blow to Robin after he thought "everything had gone back to normal" following his successful treatment for an intestinal blockage in 2010.Speaking of the ordeal, he explained: "All this time I'd thought it was wind cramps. But the surgeon said that was typical of the way it manifests. The blockage was so bad that he was surprised it hadn't burst the day before, but it was too dangerous to delay any longer."The relief was enormous, and afterwards I needed no painkillers. Not even an aspirin. I have a vegetarian diet, and a great appetite. Everything seemed to go back to normal."Related LinksBee Gee Robin Gibb says his health is improvingRobin Gibb 'determined' to beat stomach problemsReport ErrorAdvertisementCTV News Video NetworkfalseLIVE NOW: U.K. lawmakers debate Donald Trump banCTV NewsCTV NewsCTV NewsCTV NewsMost Popular Stories1Business elite meet in shadow of report: 62 own same wealth as half the planet2Player traded, sent to minors after being voted NHL all-star captain13Suncor, Canadian Oil Sands agree to $6.6B deal4Match-fixing allegations overshadow tennis at Australian Open15B.C. college athlete, 2 others found dead in upstate N.Y.16Calgary teen paralyzed in tobogganing accident17NY state police to release more details on death of B.C. athlete, 2 others185 things to know on Monday, January 18, 20169'They're saving me': Golden retrievers rescued from Istanbul end up in Barrie110Article calling Canada 'suddenly hip' elicits cheers, jeers1Don't MissfalseExtended: Falcon 9 rocket explodes after failed landingfalseExtended: Avalanche streams down Swiss mountainfalseBirkin or bust: Are high-end luxury goods a good investment?You will need to enable JavaScript in order to use the Widget.About CTVCareersCTV News StoxAdvertise on CTVBell Media Press RoomPrivacy PolicyTerms and ConditionsProducer GuidelinesContact UsLocal NewsCTV Atlantic NewsCTV Calgary NewsCTV Edmonton NewsCTV Kitchener NewsCTV Montreal NewsCTV Northern Ontario NewsCTV Ottawa NewsCTV Regina NewsCTV Saskatoon NewsCTV Toronto NewsCTV Vancouver NewsCTV Winnipeg NewsCTV TwoAtlanticAlbertaBarrieLondonOttawaWindsorVancouver IslandCTV News ProgramsCTV National NewsCanada AMPower PlayW5CTV Question PeriodVideo Sign InVideo Sign OutCTV News GOVideo HelpCTV News on MobileSite loginPlease read our guidelines before commenting on stories.View Mobile SiteUse of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy PolicyÂ© 2016 All rights reserved.Bell Media TelevisionBack to top
