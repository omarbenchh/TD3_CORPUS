You should have covered up more.'"When I protested, the others joined in, and the man said, 'You should have used a towel.'"I was really shocked, especially as I'd gone to a lot of effort to be discreet."You usually get nice comments when you're with a baby, and I couldn't believe I was having this conversation."In their world, it was completely unnatural that they should see me doing that."Despite the support of another customer, Mrs Jones-Hughes was visibly shaken and reduced to tears by the incident.She said: "After they left, the manager came over to ask what happened and was mortified when I told him."When I calmed down it reminded me of all the stories I've heard from other women who've had similar experiences."After drumming up support online, Mrs Jones-Hughes encouraged other women to brave the cold to feed their babies as part of the flashmob at the Clock Tower.The customer services manager, who also has a three-year-old daughter Lexie, said she hoped the event would give confidence to mothers who are nervous about breastfeeding in public.She said: "I've had comments from all over the country about how great it is to make a stand."I've got two daughters who may have children themselves one day. If they choose to breastfeed in the future I'd never want anyone to make them feel how I felt."Local NCT committee member Suzanne Borrell said: "There is an assumption that Brighton is generally seen as a very tolerant, broad-minded community but as this and previous unpleasant episodes show, nowhere is safe from such bigotry."Faruk Bulut, the owner of the cafe in Brighton's Kensington Gardens, said he supported the right of mothers to breastfeed their children where they want.He added: "The restaurant was very busy when the incident happened so I wasn't aware of it until afterwards."We support the idea that mothers should feel free to feed their babies and we never make it difficult for them. In fact, the cafe is very popular with mothers."DailyMirror>Recommended in UK NewsSainsbury'sSainsbury's recall BREAD amid fears it has been contaminated with METALZoosWatch two huge gorillas trade blows in furious zoo enclosure punch-upPoliticsYou don't know your wife's bra size?
