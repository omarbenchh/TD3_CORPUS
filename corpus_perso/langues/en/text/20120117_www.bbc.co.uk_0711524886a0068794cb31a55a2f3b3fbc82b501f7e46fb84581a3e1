But recent research has shown that some wild birds' patterns of flights and stopovers during migrations, or moulting times, differ between El Nino and La Nina years."Our best guess is this brings together birds [in La Nina conditions] that don't otherwise mix, and that allows the genetic reassortment to take place," Professor Shaman told BBC News.Yet the fact that many other La Nina periods have not been followed by a pandemic indicate that other factors must also be involved.If the swine flu pandemic of 2009-10 was part of this pattern, the crossing of viral strains must have had something to do with birds as well as pigs.As wild migratory birds will sometimes visit farms and as domestic flocks of ducks or chickens often live alongside pigs, especially in developing countries, this is quite feasible.Professor Shaman cautions that the link is far from being firm enough that it could be used as a tool to forecast pandemics.But the monitoring of birds, pigs, people and the genetics of the influenza virus have all been stepped up in response to recent outbreaks of both swine flu and bird flu.And this, he believes, should in time show whether the theory is correct."Now we can look at viral gene flow in a number of birds, pigs and people - and we might be able to get something more statistically robust, to get a better sense of the mechanisms."Follow Richard on TwitterShare this story About sharingEmailFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinMore on this storyCan crowdsourcing beat the flu?18 November 2011Q&A: Advice about swine flu1 July 2010Closing the door on potential pandemics27 July 2009How to make a swine flu vaccine1 May 2009Related Internet linksPNASMailman School of Public Health, Columbia UniversityInfluenza - World Health OrganizationThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesTop Stories1,050 jobs lost at Tata steel plantsMore than 1,000 jobs are to go at Tata steel plants - with the bulk going in Port Talbot - the company confirms.18 January 2016France soldiers die in Alps avalanche18 January 2016Trump ban 'would make him a martyr'18 January 2016FeaturesLost in translation?Is speaking English a problem for Muslim women?His boy JohnSolving the mystery of Rudyard Kipling’s sonSky spectrumWhat causes an upside-down rainbow?Who is Bill?Meet the super-smart stick man taking the internet by stormA black Nancy Drew?Rebooting old favourites with new facesBackhandersHave top tennis players been paid to lose?Rhodes dilemmaShould a controversial statue come down?Undone by modernityThe last practitioners of India's dying professionsBig decision'Being pregnant was always going to be risky for me'News navigationSectionsHomeUKUK HomeEnglandN.
