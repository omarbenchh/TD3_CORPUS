In order to protect our patients, and members of the public, we are closing hospital wards to all visitors (with some exceptions).“Additionally we are asking the public only to come to A&E if it is a real emergency, and if people do need to come to A&E please don’t bring the whole family - just one person to accompany the patient.“These measures are necessary to protect our patients and public from the highly contagious norovirus which causes projectile vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhoea.”The ban on visitors is expected to last for 24-48 hours.The spokesperson said if members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease, they should not go to A&E as there is no treatment for this virus, it needs to run its course over two or three days.The best advice is stay indoors, isolate yourself from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated.For further advice call NHS Direct 0845 4647.TrendingFive men guilty of violent street fight in Houghton RegisHoughton Regis sperm donor: ‘I’ve fathered 800 kids’Woman in Houghton Regis comes home to find strange men in houseThieves steal £250k stock in major heist at Dunstable depotManshead in special measures after being hit with ‘inadequate’ Ofsted ratingMore from NewsPolice clock motorist doing 99 in 30mph streetLocal News‘Why’s the rainbow’s upside down grandma?’Local NewsFamily row ends with two men jailed for assaultLocal NewsIt’s a white laugh for park’s exotic animalsLocal NewsGadget to take the ‘poo’ out of walkiesLocal NewsFree help from Garden AidersLocal NewsBack to the top of the pageNewsSportWhat's OnWeatherPlace your AdSubscribeSpecial FeaturesDealsShopHolidaysDatingBingoBuy A PhotoLocal news on the moveKeep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.Visit this website on your mobile to start enjoying it on the move.Place your Ad onlineCreate your own advertisement or send someone a special message.You can sell your car, unwanted items or place a family announcement through our newspapers and websites at really low prices.
