Further research is needed to determine if and how headphone use compromises pedestrian safety.”Edmund King, president of the AA, also commented on the Injury Prevention study, saying:“We can’t stop the march of technology but we need to halt the iPod pedestrian, cycle and driver zombies. Whether on two feet, two wheels or four, too many people are suffering from iPod oblivion.“When on the move our brains have much to take in and using technological gadgets means that our brains can’t always concentrate on so many things at once. This is when we walk into traffic; don’t hear the truck or drive cocooned from the outside world.“The US research suggests that this problem may be growing so we all need to use common sense to ensure that technological cocooning doesn’t endanger our lives or the lives of others.”TAGSheadphonesSciencesoundPrevious articleOwn goal as footballer Rocco Quinn breaks into neighbour’s homeNext articleDonald Trump awarded Scottish coat of arms after four year battleKirsty ToppingNO COMMENTSFacebookGoogle+LinkedinTwitterRedditWhatsAppXingMoreNews by EmailEnter your email Address below to receive our daily round-up of newsRelated ArticlesGreatest extinction driven by acidic oceansIain Banks inspiring space travelIt’s light Jim, but not as we know itChimp murder as bad as Mexico say Scots academicsOur News SectionsOur News SectionsDeadline News Bonnington Bond 29 Breadalbane Street Edinburgh EH6 5JWTel: 0131 561 2244Trending on deadlineHibs head coach Alan Stubbs admis Jason Cummings has been offered lucrative new dealHibs midfielder Liam Henderson thrilled to hear Anthony Stokes could be joining him at Easter RoadScots teenager emerges as UK's brightest skiing hope'We've gone soft!'
