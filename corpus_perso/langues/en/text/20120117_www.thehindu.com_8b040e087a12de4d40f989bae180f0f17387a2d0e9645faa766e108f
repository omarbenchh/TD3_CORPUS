It also said the World Health Organisation (WHO) had not advocated testing for drug resistance beyond a form of tuberculosis known as XDR-TB, or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.“For now,” the statement said, “these cases [in Mumbai] are defined as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, according to WHO definitions, and can be managed by national XDR-TB treatment guidelines.” The term, totally drug-resistant tuberculosis, is neither recognised by the WHO nor by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, it said.The statement added that the government had sent a team of doctors to Mumbai to ascertain the facts about the new kind of tuberculosis, but did not say when their findings might become available or how it had determined the new disease was treatable with existing medications.Medecins Sans Frontiers, the international health organisation, described the findings as a “public health emergency,” and a stark warning of what could lie ahead if India does not “wise up” to the tuberculosis threat. Leena Menghnaey, an MSF spokesperson, said the core problem was that “access to TB drugs in India is not regulated and anyone can get hold of them at any doses for any length of time.”Failure to complete the full course of treatment with appropriate drugs has led to the emergence of tuberculosis variants that are resistant to the best available medication. Researchers at Hinduja Hospital, where four cases of tuberculosis totally resistant to drugs, said these patients had previously only been treated in the private sector.“This is probably only the tip of the iceberg in India,” Ms. Menghnaey said, calling on the government to take measures to prevent the casual over-the-counter sale of antibiotics.About 1,000 people die of tuberculosis in the country every day and 40 per cent of the population believed to be infected may be afflicted with the full-fledged disease at some point the immunity of an individual is low. The bacteria settles down in the human body and has a long gestation period running into several years or even decades. Irregular drug dosage can result in the bacterial mutating into forms resistant to treatment. Though there is a protocol to be followed for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, erroneous use by unqualified doctors has led to a spiralling problem.India's official treatment strategy covers about 75 per cent of the patient load at present, and has shown positive results with the number of deaths falling drastically to 2.8 lakh per year from 5 lakh in just about 10 years. However, the problem occurs when the public health system fails to deliver due to lack of medicines or human resources, either forcing people to drop out from the treatment or opt for private doctors who do not stick to the protocols due to the free availability of tuberculosis drugs in the market or even prescribe wrong combinations for quicker treatment which can be disastrous.Multi-drug resistant TB is becoming more prevalent, because more people drop out as the treatment is spread over two years, and 100 times more expensive.The photograph accompanying this article has been removed to ensure patient privacyKeywords: Drug-Resistant TB, tuberculosis, Totally Drug-Resistant TB, WHO, Extensively Drug-Resistant TBView comments(2)RELATED NEWSAre the days of incurable diseases really over?

As many strains are becoming MDR-TB and XMDR tuberculosis. Our students and lab workers are the real victims. In spite of great bio hazards of Mycobacterium the so called senior professors do not have any idea about the dangers of Tuberculosis, I request all the younger generation of Microbiologists to demand Biosaftey facilities, if you are taking any research work.Even the Medical council of India should implement strict regulations on this matterfrom: Dr.T.V.Rao, MDPosted on: Jan 18, 2012 at 19:56 ISTIt's not right to show the patient's face.from: Easwaran RaviPosted on: Jan 18, 2012 at 07:43 ISTThis article is closed for comments.Please Email the EditorLatest in this sectionBack to the futurePoor pay may see doctors desert government hospitalsToday's PaperePaperThis Day That AgeCrosswordArchiveGroup SitesThe Hinduதி இந்துBusiness LineBL on CampusSportstarliveFrontlineThe Hindu CentreImagesClassifiedsRoofandFloorThe Hindu: Home | Today's Paper | News | National | International | Opinion | Business | Sport | thREAD | Features | Sci-Tech | Entertainment | The Site: | About Us | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Contacts | Archive | Subscribe | RSS Feeds | Site MapGroup Sites: The Hindu | தி இந்து | Business Line | BL on Campus | Sportstarlive | Frontline | The Hindu Centre | RoofandFloor | Publications | eBooks | Images | Classifieds |Comments to: web.thehindu@thehindu.co.in Copyright© 2016, The Hindu
