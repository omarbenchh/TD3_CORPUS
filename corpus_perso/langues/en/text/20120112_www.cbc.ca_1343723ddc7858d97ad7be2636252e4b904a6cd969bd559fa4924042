The average survival rate has increased, however.The report also shows the four most common cancers diagnosed in the city — female breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer — are not unlike most other areas. But Ottawa does have a lower rate of both prostate and cervical cancer diagnoses than the rest of Ontario.For men, the most common cancers were prostate, colorectal, lung and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most deadly of male cancers were lung, colorectal, prostate and pancreatic cancers.For women, cancer was most prevalent in the breast, lung, colon and body of the uterus. The most deadly were lung, breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.Overall, survival rates have increased in the city between five-year periods of 1993-1997 and 2003-2007.The data is about five years old so the report warns the information "may not be a truly representative picture of the current burden of cancer in Ottawa."You can read the full report here, which will be presented to the Ottawa Board of Health on Jan. 16.Report TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterLatest Ottawa News HeadlinesFraser Holmes, guitarist, remembered in song after cancer battlevideoOntario freezes hospital parking rates, offers long-term discountreadcommentsGay Syrian refugee finds acceptance in Canada after facing dire threats at homeCarling Avenue reopened after elderly man struck by vehicleOttawa agencies overwhelmed by fast pace of refugee arrivals videoLatest Audio and VideoAlex Holmes says his brother didn't want traditional funeral0:47Alex Holmes says his brother, Fraser Holmes, wanted a concert celebration instead of a traditional funeral.Failure Report Siblings11:07The death of their mother a year ago, left an Ottawa man, in the care of his sister.Naloxone4:41It's called the overdose antidote and Health Canada may soon make it available over-the-counter.Express Entry6:50It was supposed to bring the best and brightest workers to Canada but one year in, the Express Entry system isn't living up to that promise.Top News HeadlinesRona Ambrose to address 'rapidly deteriorating' Canadian economyvideoTrudeau to address reporters as cabinet meets to discuss budget, key promisesreadcommentsvideoHow the new discount airlines could save you money, even if you don't fly them readcommentsEarth's oceans absorbed colossal amount of heat in past 18 yearsreadcomments'Get a court order,' Apple tells widow seeking late husband's passwordvideoMost ViewedFraser Holmes, guitarist, remembered in song after cancer battleAngry Ottawans take out frustrations on the wrong JimCarling Avenue reopened after elderly man struck by vehicleNational Research Council in Ottawa to study failure of Nipigon River BridgeOttawa agencies overwhelmed by fast pace of refugee arrivalsScott, Albert street OC Transpo bus detour began SundayCatherine McKenna, environment minister, turns off her phone for family2 people seriously injured in snowmobile crash near RenfrewKeep dogs away from waterways, Ottawa fire officials warn3 OPP officers charged after 18-month drug trafficking investigationDon't MissFraser Holmes, guitarist, remembered in song after cancer battleOntario freezes hospital parking rates, offers long-term discountGay Syrian refugee finds acceptance in Canada after facing dire threats at homeCarling Avenue reopened after elderly man struck by vehicleOttawa agencies overwhelmed by fast pace of refugee arrivalsOttawa weather forecast brings frostbite advisory, fresh snowScott, Albert street OC Transpo bus detour began SundayComic strips, fictional artists at the Carleton University Art GalleryAngry Ottawans take out frustrations on the wrong JimKeep dogs away from waterways, Ottawa fire officials warn2 people seriously injured in snowmobile crash near RenfrewCBC Ottawa's news quiz for the week of Jan. 10National Research Council in Ottawa to study failure of Nipigon River BridgeEvery earthquake felt in Canada from 1985Ottawa hockey analytics conference goes beyond the boxscoreExplore CBCCBC HomeTVRadioNewsSportsMusicArtsKidsLocalDocumentariesComedyBooksParentsAboriginalWeatherCBC ConnectsDigital ArchivesGamesContestsSite MapStay ConnectedMobileRSSPodcastsNewsletters & AlertsServices and InformationCorporate InfoPublic AppearancesCommercial ServicesReuse & PermissionTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCBC ShopHelpContact UsJobsDoing Business with UsRenting FacilitiesCBCRadio-Canada©2016 CBC/Radio-Canada.
