It provides the first direct evidence of how alcohol makes people feel good.''Researchers took scans on the brains of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 non-drinkers after they had alcohol. Their findings, published in the Science Translational Medicine journal, showed alcohol caused endorphins to be released in the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex brain regions.with Telegraph, LondonTweetPin Itsubmit to redditEmail articlePrintReprints & permissionsAdvertisementMost popular1'Swedish Fritzl' accused of drugging and raping ...Contains:2Ken Elliott and wife Jocelyn built a surgery for ...Contains:3British parliament to debate banning Donald Trump ...Contains:4Son of Saul, Oscar-nominated Holocaust film, ...Contains:5Islamic State abducts 400 civilians in Syria, ...Contains:HuffPost AustraliaThe Winners And Losers Of Indonesia's War On TerrorHuffPost Australia external siteFour Released American Prisoners On Their Way Home After Months Of Top-Secret NegotiationsHuffPost Australia external siteFollow Us on FacebookThe Sydney Morning Herald - smh.com.auFeatured advertisersSpecial offersView these special deals by Mozo.AdvertisementReal EstateLooking to purchase your first home?
