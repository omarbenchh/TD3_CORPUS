He wasn't moving. He was getting cold."Ms Wheaton told the inquest that she had not been told of the risks of the treatment used on Tama, who was given a Maori name meaning boy.Tama's father and Ms Wheaton held hands during the inquest, which continues before deputy state coroner Scott Mitchell.Increase Text SizeDecrease Text SizePrintEmailShareAdd to DiggAdd to del.icio.usAdd to FacebookAdd to KwoffAdd to MyspaceAdd to NewsvineWhat are these?Back to top of pageNewsPolice hunt van in NSW bikie murder probeFTSE in lowest close in three yearsDon McLean on domestic violence chargeUS says Aust doing enough in IraqElderly man dies in Hobart head-on crashNewsBreaking NewsNationalWorldWeirdTechnologyOpinionPhotosMost ViewedNeighbour charged with woman’s murderVideo: Gayle tonks fastest T20 half-centurySmall grassfire took 12 minutes to eruptMum demands justice for slain daughterTarantino stuns Melbourne audienceDustin’s dinner clash ‘tense’Dons zero in on top-up playersMcGuire: ‘Idiots’ were sucked inNewsNeighbour charged with woman’s murderA NEIGHBOUR has been charged with the murder of a woman whose body was found in scrub after she went missing in the state’s northeast.Law & Order1 videoBody found in search for missing woman 0:31Recipe for tissue repair a skin cell breakthroughMELBOURNE researchers have created the “recipe book” for turning skin cells into ­almost any other cell in the human body.VIC NewsTarantino stuns Melbourne audienceHOLLYWOOD superstars Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell closed down Yarraville last night as they made a surprise visit to a local cinema.ArtsDustin’s dinner clash ‘tense’THE dining partner of a woman who claimed Richmond ace Dustin Martin threatened her with a chopstick in a Melbourne restaurant, has spoken publicly for the first time.News1 videoGillon McLachlan Evidence refuted allegation 1:09Aussie’s inspirational road to Dakar gloryTHERE’S no chance that the first Australian to win the Dakar Rally will lose his head — as “it’s screwed on quite literally” after a 2013 accident that threatened his career.News1 videoToby Price shocked at his success 0:50Subscriber ExclusivesToday’s super is a story of lost wealthIN two weeks of trading this year, the Australian stock market has fallen about 8 per cent.
