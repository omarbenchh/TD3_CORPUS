It seems Japan has adopted one of the West's nasty four-lettered words with great gusto, using it to describe anything that's really fantastic.A New Yorker says he is to blame for this recent phenomenon. Owner and chef for a restaurant chain called Bubby's, Ron Silver was in Yokohama, Japan in 2009 setting up a branch of the restaurant there when he insisted on fresh produce. According to Silver, the Japanese use a lot of frozen goods and in his frustration to explain fresh to his staff, he ranted at them, "I mean f**king fresh, man."The following day, his staff asked him whether by fresh he meant canned, which started him ranting again, " What do you not understand about f**ing fresh?"According to the original report on Gawker.com, Silver's staff may have been teasing him the whole time as they soon decorated the Bubby's logo with the slogan, "f***kin fresh".So catchy is it, that it's become the unofficial slogan of the Osaka branch, written on the menus and adverts, like "F**kin Fresh & Delicious food" and "Bubby's F**kin Fresh lemonade" — dropping the "g" seems a popular spelling of the word.Now, it seems, the new-found adjective has been adopted elsewhere, with signs advertising a "f**kin sale" in Osaka, Japan, recently reported by Gawker.com.Whether or not the phrase originated at Bubby's, one thing is for certain, the Japanese have a certain way with the English language.Related ArticlesBraille burgers open sesameKids eat with their eyesNicotine won't help you quitCommentsPlease NoteBy commenting on this article, you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of the iafrica.com comments system.Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.blog comments powered by DisqusIn Focus TodayNewsBusinessSportFoundation decries racism against whitesThe FW de Klerk Foundation has announced that it has submitted a complaint to the SAHRC regarding social media posts against white people.Read more ›'SAA must fly under own power'Parastatals such as South African Airways should learn to stand on their own two feet, Minister Pravin Gordhan said.Read more ›Lions' injured stars in a race against timeThe Lions will be sweating over the fitness of a few key players ahead of this year's Super Rugby competition.Read more ›Sponsored LinksWine Of The WeekWork Money SmarterSave on insuranceDatingWomenMenSearchFind love now.
