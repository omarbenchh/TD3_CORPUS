(CBC)Dozens of people ill in a suspected outbreak of norovirus at a student journalism conference in Victoria are under voluntary quarantine in their hotel rooms.About 60 of the 360 people attending the Canadian University Press's annual NASH conference for student journalists are in voluntary isolation Sunday at the Harbour Towers Hotel and Suites in downtown Victoria, delegate Emma Godmere told CBC News.Godmere, who also fell ill, said paramedics attended the hotel early Sunday morning. Several others went to hospital overnight with what's believed to be norovirus.Laura Brown of The Aquinian, a student newspaper at Fredericton's St. Thomas University, said that five out of 10 of the paper's staff at the conference have symptoms of norovirus, which include vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, headaches and muscle aches."B.C. Public Health ... suggested that based on the evidence that we were sharing with them and the fast spread of what this was, that we're looking at norovirus. It hasn't exactly been confirmed by anyone yet but that's the assumption that we're working with now," said Godmere, CUP's national bureau chief from Toronto.Paramedics respond to the Victoria hotel where delegates at a student conference fell ill. (CBC)Delegates had a buffet dinner at the hotel and then boarded buses for an event at the University of Victoria. People started getting sick on the buses, said Jonny Wakefield, a University of British Columbia student. He said three people from his student newspaper fell ill."First it was just the one guy who threw up on the back of my head, so for a while I was angry at him. Then I found out everyone else was throwing up as well," said delegate Brennan Bova. The post-dinner event was cancelled.Most out-of-town delegates were to return home on Sunday, but those who are sick have been asked not to leave the hotel. It's caused some rebooking headaches for the students."According to the messages that the conference co-ordinator has been sending us, it's not an official quarantine under B.C. Health, so WestJet can't give us any accommodation," said Brown.The 74th NASH conference began Wednesday and ended Sunday in Victoria. It was hosted by the Martlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria, and the Nexus, the paper for students at Camosun College.Report TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterLatest British Columbia NewsMatthew Hutchinson death: Rochester police speak to mediaNine-year-old Vancouver actor gets Critics' Choice Award for role in Roomvideo'Get a court order,' Apple tells widow seeking late husband's passwordvideoProtesters from Gustafsen Lake standoff renew calls for national inquiryaudioOver 1,000 needles found in Prince George drug house bustTop News HeadlinesRona Ambrose says Liberals ill-equipped to deal with 'rapidly deteriorating' economyvideoHow new discount airlines could save you money, even if you don't fly them readcommentsEarth's oceans absorbed colossal amount of heat in past 18 yearsreadcommentsKevin O'Leary and Peter MacKay top Tory leadership pollreadcommentsGoodwill CEO to speak after abrupt closure of GTA storesreadcommentsvideoMost ViewedMatthew Hutchinson death: Rochester police speak to mediaMatthew Hutchinson, North Vancouver hockey player, found dead in N.Y. statePacific Centre photographers get apology from Vancouver mayorPacific Centre photos: Mohammed Sharaz, son Salahuddin and Mohammed Kareem speak outOver 1,000 needles found in Prince George drug house bustLow Canadian dollar leading arts groups to reconsider programming choicesGustafsen Lake standoff: protesters renew calls for an inquiryOff-road vehicle registration rules frustrating ownersMohammed Sharaz reveals why his group took photos that aroused Vancouver suspicionsDon't MissMatthew Hutchinson death: Rochester police speak to mediaCritics' Choice Awards 2016: Spotlight, Mad Max win bigGo PublicApple demands widow get court order to access dead husband's passwordGustafsen Lake standoff: protesters renew calls for an inquiryOver 1,000 needles found in Prince George drug house bustOff-road vehicle registration rules frustrating ownersLow Canadian dollar leading arts groups to reconsider programming choicesB.C. guide dog legislation to take effect MondayCBC Investigates'Excessive fatigue' at CP an 'immediate threat' to rail safety: Transport CanadaRichest 62 people own as much wealth as half the world's population, says OxfamPacific Centre photographers get apology from Vancouver mayorSoaring price for trendy cauliflower causes problems for restaurantsIsmaili Muslim women's art exhibit in Surrey celebrates diversityAustralian Open: Eugenie Bouchard advances, Vasek Pospisil outLast working coal mine on Vancouver Island shuts down, marking end of eraExplore CBCCBC HomeTVRadioNewsSportsMusicArtsKidsLocalDocumentariesComedyBooksParentsAboriginalWeatherCBC ConnectsDigital ArchivesGamesContestsSite MapStay ConnectedMobileRSSPodcastsNewsletters & AlertsServices and InformationCorporate InfoPublic AppearancesCommercial ServicesReuse & PermissionTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCBC ShopHelpContact UsJobsDoing Business with UsRenting FacilitiesCBCRadio-CanadaÂ©2016 CBC/Radio-Canada.
