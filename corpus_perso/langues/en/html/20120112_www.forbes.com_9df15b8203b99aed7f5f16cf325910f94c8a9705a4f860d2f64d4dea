Four decades later, we still argue about how successful it was. But it accomplished one thing: It raised the profile of a disease that people didn't even want to talk about. If President Obama runs with this draft framework, he can do the same for Alzheimer's and other dementias. That itself would be an important contribution.

It would be great to see a new partnership where, in return for research funding, government receives an equity share of profits from any blockbuster Alzheimer drug that is developed with its support. In an era of budget cuts, plowing that funding back into public research programs could go a long way towards supporting future studies.</p>\n<p>I remember President Nixon’s 1971 war on cancer. Four decades later, we still argue about how successful it was. But it accomplished one thing: It raised the profile of a disease that people didn’t even want to talk about. If President Obama runs with this draft framework, he can do the same for Alzheimer’s and other dementias. That itself would be an important contribution. But it won’t be enough.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\"> \n <img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=c012f2ee-1969-4806-8efe-a9e72a2a5aa6\" alt=\"\" /> \n <span class=\"zem-script pretty-attribution more-related\"></span> \n</div>"],"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_4","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Pharma & Healthcare","url":"/healthcare"},{"id":"channel_1section_7","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Washington","url":"/washington"},{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_14","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Retirement","url":"/retirement"},{"id":"channel_7","channelName":"Lifestyle","url":"/lifestyle"},{"id":"channel_7section_47","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Health","url":"/health"}],"pTagCount":0,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-1699","name":"Caring for Our Parents","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/howardgleckman/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1452872430394,"recentFlag":false,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-1699","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/138531","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/138531","name":"Howard Gleckman","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e28bc68dcaa04525a1c3e1096b274d0?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e28bc68dcaa04525a1c3e1096b274d0?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e28bc68dcaa04525a1c3e1096b274d0?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e28bc68dcaa04525a1c3e1096b274d0?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover news on Washington","description":"I am author of the book \"Caring for Our Parents\" and resident fellow at The Urban Institute, where I am affiliated with the Tax Policy Center and the Program on Retirement Policy.
