He has had personal experience of the effects of Alheimzer's through his late father-in-law and chose to donate part of the proceeds to the charity.Mr Buckley said: "I have known Gordon King for about 20 years. I approached Darcey Bussell out of the blue and she was very willing to help from the start." He accompanied Mr King to the Royal Opera House to do the original sketches and photographs.The launch also provided the latest project for website design company E-creation, also in Gerrards Cross, which Mr Buckley found through the Register of Accredited Service Providers supported by Thames Valley Business Link.He said: "It was not only the quality of service, but the level of support that E-creation provided which was impressive."Share articleThe prints, priced between £225 and £265 are being sold either direct from Ever English Ltd at 31 Howards Wood Drive, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 7HR or via the internet at www.everenglish.comPromoted StoriesCommenting & ModerationWe moderate all comments on Evening Times on either a pre-moderated or post-moderated basis.
