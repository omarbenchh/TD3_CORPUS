Coroners Service has asked for toxicology tests to be carried out as soon as possible to determine if ecstasy played a role in the death of a 16-year-old Langley boy.The tests, requested from the provincial toxicology lab, will determine whether the boy took the drug and, if he did, whether the doses he took contained PMMA (paramethoxy-methamphetamine), a drug recently linked to five deaths in the province.“Because of our concern around these [cases] we are trying to prioritize them and move them to the head of the queue,” Barb McClintock, a spokeswoman for the coroners office, said Monday, adding that it’s hoped results would be available within days.The Provincial Toxicology Centre will conduct the tests.The coroners service said Monday it was investigating the death of a boy who was with others when he reportedly took ecstasy along with other drugs on Jan. 15. When he collapsed, someone nearby called 911 and an ambulance arrived and rushed the boy to Langley Memorial Hospital, but he could not be revived.Last week, the Coroners Service announced that PMMA had been linked to five ecstasy-related deaths in the province in the past six months, with two of those deaths occurring in January. PMMA has also been linked to several recent deaths in Alberta.Police and the coroners office have emphasized the risks of taking ecstasy, saying there is no known safe dose.In an interview last week, chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said it isn’t clear whether the PMMA was in one batch or not.“It could be just the tip of the iceberg. There could be thousands and thousands of pills out there with PMMA,” Ms. Lapointe said Friday in an interview. “That’s the worry. We just don’t know. It’s an illicit substance.”It’s thought that PMMA is being introduced, perhaps accidentally, in the process of manufacturing ecstasy.The drug is not routinely tested for, but B.C. reviewed toxicology findings for 12 ecstasy-related deaths in 2011 and two deaths this year after PMMA was linked to ecstasy-related deaths in Alberta.Although PMMA was detected in five cases, the coroners service emphasized that 13 other ecstasy-related deaths in the same period did not involve PMMA.“The finding of PMMA in five recent cases confirms the danger that has always been associated with taking ecstasy: There is no guarantee of purity in a drug that is concocted for profit in a clandestine environment,” the office said.Police have said there are an average 20 deaths from ecstasy each year in British Columbia.Follow Wendy Stueck on Twitter: @wendy_stueckTopics:LangleyAlbertaCommentsPrint /LicenseAANext StoryA Montreal castle fit for a software kingMonday, Jan. 18, 2016 2:52PM ESTSite of Salem witch trial hangings confirmed by researchersMonday, Jan. 18, 2016 2:40PM ESTAFC Championship could be final game in storied Brady-Manning rivalryMonday, Jan. 18, 2016 2:54PM ESTIn the knowglobal wealthHow the world’s 62 richest people own more than half the planet doesLifeThis Wyoming hotel stands out like a weasel in a henhouseReport on BusinessSmall increases to your savings can make a big difference to your nest eggLifeCalifornia offers plenty of alternative wineries outside Napa ValleyMost popular videos »Globe DriveThe three coolest new cars revealed at the Detroit auto showArtsAnatomy of a scene: Is this the performance that wins Leo an Oscar?Report on BusinessHow do I know if I should avoid RRSPs like the plague?LifeThis exercise is called Take No Prisoners for a reasonLifeThree ways to cover stubborn grey roots (and save some cash)NewsSecurity footage shows massive cougar in North Vancouver backyardArtsThis is what a 500-person choir singing Bowie's 'Space Oddity' sounds likeReport on BusinessBelgian drone mixes plane and quadcopter technologyReport on BusinessThis week in business: Bank of Canada's interest rate decisionLifeThe ice cold call of winter surfing in Ontario (and why anyone would listen to it)Report on BusinessOn Blue Monday, don't let debt get you downNewsClinton, Sanders spar in last debate before Iowa◀●●●▶HighlightsGlobe InvestorBeing executor of a will likely ‘most stressful experience you’ll ever have’Globe InvestorFive U.S. sectors expected to outperform in 2016More from The Globe and MailReport on BusinessHow much did COS really win in Suncor battle?LifeNathalie Atkinson: Watching women walk, from a 1922 film gala to the 2016 OscarsMost popularLearn English or else: U.K. sends message to Muslim womenHow the world’s 62 richest people own more than half the planet doesRivals drop the rancour as Suncor, COS get $4.2-billion dealMorning Briefing: Analysts warn of further decay as loonie nears 68¢ before firmingRob Carrick: Eight reasons why a Bank of Canada rate cut is a bad ideaconnect with usProductsThe Globe and Mail NewspaperNewspaper delivered to your doorstep.
