Ratings will also be available online.The Welsh government launched a consultation into the food hygiene rating bill.Consumers will vote with their feet. If these businesses are obliged to put up their score, and a score of zero is put on the door, then obviously you will choose to eat elsewhereDr Prysor Williams, Bangor universityIn August, Conservative assembly leader Andrew RT Davies said E. coli outbreaks were too frequent.He was speaking after a kebab house in Cardiff was closed temporarily when a number of people fell ill in an outbreak of E. coli O157.'Low scores'The Welsh government said a mandatory scheme has been backed by Prof Hugh Pennington who chaired a public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli outbreak in south Wales.This was the second biggest E.coli outbreak in the UK and which resulted in one death, 150 cases including 31 hospital admissions and long-term health consequences for several children.Health Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "It is already a legal requirement for food businesses to meet hygiene regulations set out in food law, but businesses are not currently required to display their ratings and those with low scores generally do not display them."Compulsory display of hygiene ratings will encourage all businesses to improve their procedures and drive up standards."I know it could put some people out of business but if this is done properly it will provide customers with better protectionKaren Morrisroe, E. coli victim in 2009About 30,000 businesses in Wales would be covered by the scheme which could be in operation by 2014.Currently, more than 13,500 have been rated under a voluntary scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), although it is estimated that only one in three display their rating.The Welsh government said the FSA will continue to make funding available to Welsh local authorities so they can carry out advisory visits to businesses to help them improve their food hygiene ratings.Karen Morrisroe, who became seriously ill after an E. coli outbreak linked to a fish and chip shop at Llay, Wrexham two years ago has welcomed the move."I'm all in favour of a mandatory system," she told BBC Wales."I know it could put some people out of business but if this is done properly it will provide customers with better protection."During the outbreak it emerged that the fish bar had been given a 0 out of 5 rating by council officials after an earlier food hygiene inspection.Media captionHeather Cheetham runs the Habit tea room in Llandudno explains the food guidelines she must followIts former owner Ramazan Aslan was later jailed for eight months for hygiene offences. The takeaway is now under new management not connected with the previous owner.Dr Prysor Williams from Bangor University said a compulsory scheme would force food businesses to "up their game"."There may be some resentment by businesses, by industry, but ultimately I think it is in their interests as well," said the lecturer in environmental management."It will help reward those businesses that are actually implementing good hygiene practises, because they will help draw more business."Consumers will vote with their feet. If these businesses are obliged to put up their score, and a score of zero is put on the door, then obviously you will choose to eat elsewhere."That will effectively force them to improve their game."A Consumer Focus Wales survey in October showed that 94% of people in Wales thought it should be compulsory for food businesses to display their food hygiene rating score.Consumer Focus Wales director Maria Battle said: "The consultation presents a great opportunity for the people of Wales to voice any concerns they have about food safety and to press the government to make further improvements."Share this story About sharingEmailFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinMore on this storyE. coli outbreak: Adonis Kebab House in Cardiff reopens27 August 2011E. coli: Welsh Tories urge mandatory food hygiene signs15 August 2011Safety call after E.coli inquiry19 March 2009Related Internet linksConsumer Focus WalesFood Standards Agency: WalesWelsh governmentThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesTop Stories1,050 jobs lost at Tata steel plantsMore than 1,000 jobs are to go at Tata steel plants - with the bulk going in Port Talbot - the company confirms.18 January 2016France soldiers die in Alps avalanche18 January 2016Trump ban 'would make him a martyr'18 January 2016FeaturesLost in translation?Is speaking English a problem for Muslim women?His boy JohnSolving the mystery of Rudyard Kipling’s sonSky spectrumWhat causes an upside-down rainbow?Who is Bill?Meet the super-smart stick man taking the internet by stormA black Nancy Drew?Rebooting old favourites with new facesBackhandersHave top tennis players been paid to lose?Rhodes dilemmaShould a controversial statue come down?Undone by modernityThe last practitioners of India's dying professionsBig decision'Being pregnant was always going to be risky for me'News navigationWalesSectionsWalesWales PoliticsNorth WestNorth EastMidSouth WestSouth EastCymruHomeUKselectedUK HomeEnglandN.
