Martin, MDWebMD News ArchiveJan. 11, 2012 -- Transferring more than two embryos during an IVF cycle is a dangerous practice that does not improve a woman’s chances of delivering a baby, a European study finds.Researchers analyzed close to 125,000 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles performed in the U.K. over a five-year period in one of the largest studies ever to compare outcomes in women younger than 40 to those of older women.The conclusion that there is no medical justification for transferring three or more embryos, even in women over the age of 40, has major implications in the U.S., where 1 in 3 IVF procedures involves the transfer of more than two embryos.Trying to Conceive? Tips to Help You Get Pregnant3 Embryos: 1 Too Many?While that represents a decline from a decade ago, when closer to 2 out of 3 IVF procedures in the U.S. involved three or more embryos, there is still plenty of room for improvement, a study co-author says.“The practice of transferring multiple embryos is very much market-driven in the United States,” says Scott M. Nelson, MD, PhD, of the University of Glasgow Centre for Population and Health Sciences. “There is an economic incentive for transferring more embryos in the U.S., but no sound medical reason for doing so.”New York infertility specialist Glenn L. Schattman, MD, disagrees. Schattman is president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART).SART guidelines call for the transfer of one or two embryos per IVF cycle in younger patients with the best prognosis, and as many as four embryos per cycle in patients in their late 30s and 40s with a poor chance of achieving a pregnancy.He says it is clear from SART’s own statistics that the poorest-prognosis patients have a much better chance of having a baby when more than two embryos are transferred.“There is a continuous and constant decline in fertility with increasing age, so it makes no sense to treat a 39- or 40-year-old the same way we would a 26-year-old,” he says.Lower Birth Rates Seen With 3 EmbryosThe 124,148 IVF cycles analyzed by Nelson and colleague Debbie A. Lawlor, PhD, of the University of Bristol, resulted in 33,514 live births.1|2Next Page >Continue reading below...Top PicksWhen Is It Time to See a Specialist?In Vitro Fertilization: What You Need to KnowHow to Choose a Fertility ClinicHow to Pay for Infertility TreatmentsSperm Q&AInfertility and Men: What You Should KnowInfertility & Reproduction Health HomeNewsReferenceSlideshowsQuizzesVideosCommunityMedicationsFind an OB/GYNInfertility & Reproduction Guide1Overview & Facts2Symptoms & Types3Diagnosis & Tests4Treatment & Care5Living & Managing6Support & ResourcesRelated to Infertility & ReproductionEndometriosisGetting PregnantMenopauseMen's HealthMiscarriagePCOSSmoking CessationWomen’s HealthMore Related TopicsToday on WebMDGet the Fertility FactsHow much do you know about conception?Infertility TreatmentsWhich one is right for you?Ready to Get Pregnant?Why Dad's health matters.Fertility Boosters6 ways to improve your chances.SlideshowChoosing an Infertility TreatmentArticleTrying to Conceive: Myths vs. FactsVideoPrepare Your Body for PregnancySlideshowConception: Images From Egg to EmbryoArticleWhy Chart Your Menstrual Cycle?ArticleChoosing a Fertility ClinicArticleWhat Are the Signs of Infertility?ArticleIVF: What to ExpectWebMD Special SectionsOvulation CalculatorWhich Infertility Treatment is Best?Health Solutions From Our SponsorsIBS-C Symptoms?Ringing in the EarsCancer SupportAbout Your CancerExercise & OA Knee PainCML Treatment PlanAortic Valve Stenosis?New Way to Take InsulinDiagnosed with Cancer?Hearing Loss TestManaging CancerHelp with Painful KneesFrequent Constipation?Feeding a Growing WorldQuestions About HemophiliaMore From WebMD:Hemophilia Treatment|RA Basics|Psoriasis|MS Assessment|Hemophilia Questions|Preteen Vaccines|ADHD in Children|Diabetes Diet|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma |Breast Cancer|Toenail Fungus|Incontinence|COPDFind us on:URAC: Accredited Health Web SiteAdChoicesAbout WebMDAdvertise With UsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySponsor PolicySite MapCareersContact UsMedscape ReferenceeMedicineHealthRxListMedscapeMedicineNetBootsWebMDWebMD CorporateWebMD Health ServicesFirst AidWebMD MagazineWebMD Health RecordWebMD MobileNewslettersDictionaryPhysician Directory©2005-2016 WebMD, LLC.
