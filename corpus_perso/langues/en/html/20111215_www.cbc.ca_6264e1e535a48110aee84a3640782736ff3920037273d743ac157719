(Sven Hoppe)DNA testing for the human papilloma virus in cervical cancer screening is the best option for detecting the cancer in women over 30, finds a new study.The report finds suggests that HPV detection through DNA screening is more sensitive than standard Pap tests in detecting precancerous high-grade lesions on the cervix. High-risk HPV was present in nearly all cervical cancers, the authors say. In the study, women were randomly assigned to receive either HPV DNA testing and cytology or cytology alone. A second screening was conducted five years later and HPV and cytology tests were conducted at that point.The first screen found significantly more precancerous lesions (dysplasia) of Grade 2 or worse than cytology screens alone. Five years later, the second screen found significantly fewer women had cervical cancer lesions of Grade 3 or worse. The most advanced form of dysplasia, CIN 3, is actually the very earliest form of cancer, according to the Canadian Cancer Society. The authors belive that because more lesions were found at earlier stages in the first round of screening, there were significantly fewer advanced cases of cervical cancer five years later."Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN Grade 2 or worse, which when adequately treated, improves protection against CIN Grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer," reads the study.Whether HPV testing is a better diagnostic tool in a longer screening period has not been established, say the authors.The report, Human papilloma virus testing for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, was conducted by researchers at the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam and involved 45,000 women aged 29 to 56 between January 1999 and September 2002.It is published in the Wednesday online edition of the Lancet.Report TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterTop News HeadlinesRona Ambrose to address 'rapidly deteriorating' Canadian economyvideoHow the new discount airlines could save you money, even if you don't fly them readcommentsEarth's oceans absorbed colossal amount of heat in past 18 yearsreadcommentsKevin O'Leary and Peter MacKay top Tory leadership pollreadcommentsMatthew Hutchinson death: Rochester police to speak to mediavideoMust WatchLatest Health News HeadlinesPregnant women should consult doctors on travel: Brazil's health ministryreadcommentsThe downside of high rise livingreadcomments5 patients improve in fatal drug trial in France readcommentsBlue Monday is (still) just a PR gimmick, actual science showsreadcommentsUrgent care centres an overlooked option for patientsvideoFeaturesMarketplaceToxic jewelry: Cadmium found in Ardene, Aldo productsJewelry bought from popular fashion chains contains toxic cadmiumMost Viewed1 dead after botched clinical drug trial in France, 5 still in hospitalToxic jewelry: Cadmium found in Ardene, Aldo productsPregnant women in Canada, U.S., urged to postpone travel to Zika-hit countriesClinical drug trial in France sends 6 to hospital in 'serious accident'Zika virus: Hawaiian baby born with brain damage is 1st U.S. case tied to infectionEbola case in Sierra Leone discovered after epidemic declared overBest before dates and expiry dates: 5 things you may not knowGrapefruit juice interaction with drugs can be deadlyStudy reveals average penis size for menZika virus may be linked to birth defects in Brazil, health officials sayDon't MissHEALTHY NEW YEAR10 things you likely won't need for better health in 2016Human cloningHuman cloning possible but remains 'abhorrent' in minds of publicGeriatric healthWeight training may fix age-related 'potholes' in brain's highwaysMENTAL HEALTHSuicide attempts and insurance: Why you might not be coveredInherited diseaseGene editing of sperm and eggs clinically irresponsible, scientists sayAIDSHIV prevention pill called a game changer, but cost still a barrierDietChocolate health myths dissolveSWEETENERSAgave, stevia sweeteners to be used with caution, dietitian advisesAnalysisHow pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drugSUGARSugar causes hyperactivity in kids: A myth persisting for decadesFighting the fluFlu shot's 'crystal ball' science still our best defenceHealth or Hype?Cosmetics marketing focuses on 'fairy dust' ingredients that change nothingNutritionVitamins from A to Zinc: A reality checkSexual desireFlibanserin, 'female Viagra,' distracts from real causes of low libido: criticsExplore CBCCBC HomeTVRadioNewsSportsMusicArtsKidsLocalDocumentariesComedyBooksParentsAboriginalWeatherCBC ConnectsDigital ArchivesGamesContestsSite MapStay ConnectedMobileRSSPodcastsNewsletters & AlertsServices and InformationCorporate InfoPublic AppearancesCommercial ServicesReuse & PermissionTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCBC ShopHelpContact UsJobsDoing Business with UsRenting FacilitiesCBCRadio-CanadaÂ©2016 CBC/Radio-Canada.
