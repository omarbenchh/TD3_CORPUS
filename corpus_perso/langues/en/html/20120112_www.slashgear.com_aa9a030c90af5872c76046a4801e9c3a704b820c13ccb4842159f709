There are a number of health issues that come from being overweight and many of them can be lethal if not treated. One of the best treatments for the obese and the disorders that go with being overweight is exercise.The catch is that some are simply too ill to exercise. Researcher are now claiming that they have created a pill that is promised to give the person taking it the same benefits of exercise, without having to exercise. The hormone in the pill is being called irisin and occurs naturally in the body. According to the researchers, this hormone is found in normal muscle cells and triggers the calorie burning effects of exercise.Experts from Harvard Medical School believe that the new hormone could lead to treatments for obesity, diabetes, and possibly even cancer along with all sorts of other conditions that can benefit from exercise. So far, the medication has been testing in mice and in tests, the researchers found that glucose control improved and the mice lost small amounts of weight. It will be a long time yet before the medication hits the market.[via Telegraph]TagsmedicineresearchScienceMust Read Bits & BytesThis is Obama’s $4bn, 10yr plan for America’s driverless carsWhat’s inside the Samsung Galaxy S7?Lexus LC 500 does the impossible: concept made realWith Summon, your Tesla gets a virtual valetApple acquires Emotient for AI emotion detectionLatest Headlines9-year-old Xbox 360 case hits The US Supreme CourtJan 18, 2016Kylo Ren oozes with angst, makes a terrible undercover bossJan 18, 2016WhatsApp opens doors to businesses, drops subscription feesJan 18, 2016CAT S50C packs a 4.7-inch screen in a dust and waterproof packageJan 18, 2016AsteroidOS can run on some Android Wear smartwatchesJan 18, 2016Get SlashGear Weekly Wrap-upLatest ReviewsA legitimate threat to the MacBookJan 14, 2016Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance Review for NVIDIA SHIELD Android TVJan 7, 2016BoomStick Review: $99 headphone upgradeJan 3, 2016Acer Chromebook R11 Review: portable and foldableJan 1, 20162016 McLaren 650S Spider ReviewJan 1, 2016Search© 2005-2015 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.Site InformationAboutAdvertiseTip UsContactEthics StatementPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseArchivesSocial and MediaGoogle+FacebookTwitterYouTubeRSS FeedPopular TopicsSmartphoneTabletLaptopDesktopGamingStorageComputingScienceAppsTelevision
