A new report from a leading think tank suggests that bilingualism is costing the country approximately $2.4 billion per year. The province of Ontario spends the most out of all provinces with $623 million per year.The official languages recognized in Canada, according to the Constitution of Canada, are English and French. According to statistics from the 2006 census, 59 percent of Canadians speak English and a little more than 23 percent speak French.Many federal and provincial public services offer its citizens options in French and English. Unfortunately, for taxpayers, this is costing the country $2.4 billion annually; $900 million in annual provincial funding for bilingual government services and $1.5 billion the federal government spends on bilingualism, according to a Fraser Institute reported titled “Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces Costs and Benefits in 2006.”The $2.4 billion equals to $85 per Canadian taxpayer.The province of Ontario spends $623 million per year on bilingual services, which is the most out of all its counterparts. New Brunswick, which has English and French as its official languages, has the second largest budget for bilingualism with $85 million. Quebec is third at $50 million.Newfoundland and Labrador spends the least out of all provinces with $3.4 million per year.In most provinces, a substantial amount of bilingual funding is focused on primary and secondary French-language education.Study authors explain that they are not concluding whether or not bilingualism is bad public policy, but rather are highlighting the costs associated with bilingual services. “The issue we examine in this study is not whether bilingualism is good or bad policy, but the costs above and beyond that of providing education and other services in the majority language,” said Universite de Montreal economics professor, Francois Vaillancourt, in a press release.The research notes that provinces that maintain a significant francophone population could contract out government services in French to the private sector at a user-pay basis.Provincial bilingual spending:- Ontario: $623 million on bilingual services ($1,275 per francophone)- New Brunswick: $85 million ($357 per francophone)- Quebec: $50 million ($88 per francophone)- Alberta: $33 million ($534.70 per francophone)- British Columbia: $23 million ($426.90 per francophone)- Nova Scotia: $18 million ($540.10 per francophone)- Manitoba: $16 million ($410.20 per francophone)- Saskatchewan:$9.65 million ($640.50 per francophone)- Prince Edward Island: $5.1 million ($946.20 per francophone)- Newfoundland and Labrador: $3.4 million ($1780.30 per francophone)More aboutBilingualism, Fraser institute, Canada, Ontario, TaxpayersMore news fromComments (1)Latest NewsTop NewsOp-Ed: Senior official of Libyan Government of National Accord resignsDenmark's wind-powered electricity usage sets world recordPacquiao, Bradley gear up for Los Angeles, New York press tourInterview: Vince Gill is 'down to his last bad habit' SpecialDo our bodies really have more microbes than human cells?Interview: Pizza owner Dan Romano talks 'Pay It Forward' Project Special'GoFundMe' shuts down Tennessee woman's campaign for lottery lossSaudi Arabia buying up farmland in Southwestern U.S.Teen arrested after 'confessing' boyfriend's murder on Facebook'Lock up Islamic men in asylum centres' says Dutch MPOp-Ed: Libyan Political Agreement says Haftar lost his job on Dec. 17Review: David Bowie haunting on new music video for 'Lazarus' SpecialiOS source reveals Apple is working to add Li-Fi to the iPhoneCough mixture warning, and round-up of other recallsPaleontologists discover dinosaur that's as long as 3 city busesNew riot in Dutch town against refugee centreCorporateContact UsAbout UsJobsMedia CenterAdvertiseLeaderboard & AchievementsInvestors & PartnersBoard of AdvisersHelp & SupportHelp CenterFrequently Asked QuestionsEditorial GuidelinesTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCode of ConductNews LinksLatest NewsLive EventsNews AlertsDigital Journal MobileGlobal Press Releases24-7PressRelease.comGlobeNewswire Newscopyright © 2016 digitaljournal.com | powered by dell servers
