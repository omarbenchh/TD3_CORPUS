Twenty-six per cent were obese, up from 13% in 1993, when the survey was first carried out. Fifty-eight per cent of women were overweight, with 26% of those obese - up from 16% in 1993.Share this story About sharingEmailFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinRelated Internet linksNHS Information CentreFPAThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesTop Stories1,050 jobs lost at Tata steel plantsMore than 1,000 jobs are to go at Tata steel plants - with the bulk going in Port Talbot - the company confirms.18 January 2016France soldiers die in Alps avalanche18 January 2016Trump ban 'would make him a martyr'18 January 2016FeaturesLost in translation?Is speaking English a problem for Muslim women?His boy JohnSolving the mystery of Rudyard Kipling’s sonSky spectrumWhat causes an upside-down rainbow?Who is Bill?Meet the super-smart stick man taking the internet by stormA black Nancy Drew?Rebooting old favourites with new facesBackhandersHave top tennis players been paid to lose?Rhodes dilemmaShould a controversial statue come down?Undone by modernityThe last practitioners of India's dying professionsBig decision'Being pregnant was always going to be risky for me'News navigationSectionsHomeUKUK HomeEnglandN.
